# Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) Skill

AMC is Amazon's privacy-safe clean room for analyzing pseudonymized, event-level ad data. This skill covers the full AMC workflow surface: writing and debugging SQL, creating and executing workflows, building audiences, downloading results, and applying the official AMC playbooks for attribution, frequency, lookalikes, and cross-channel measurement.

Use the MCP tools exposed by the client and inspect their current schemas before calling them. The client owns server connection, authentication, and naming. Non-obvious behaviors not in tool schemas live in `references/tool-gotchas.md`.

## Account-context recovery

If Amazon account scope, identifier type, marketplace mapping, or account relationships become unclear, consult `amazon-ads-accounts` when it is available. Resume this skill after resolving the ambiguity. If it is unavailable, use equivalent read-only discovery and ask the user when multiple valid choices remain. Never guess or interchange identifier types.

## When to query the knowledge base

The `chroma_mcp` server hosts the `amazon_ads` collection — a structured corpus of AMC playbooks, attribution references, table schemas, SQL reference, and analysis templates. **Reach for it before improvising.** AMC has surprising rules and the playbooks encode hard-won patterns.

Query Chroma whenever the user asks for:

- A playbook or template (frequency, attribution, lookalikes, off-Amazon conversions, keyword clustering, programmatic audiences, CLTV, brand-store insights, etc.)
- The schema of a specific AMC table
- The "right way" to measure something (cross-channel overlap, NTB, incremental reach)
- An attribution model (first-touch, last-touch, linear, position-based)
- An audience pattern (rule-based, lookalike, upgrade-opportunity)
- AMC SQL dialect details (functions, supported/unsupported syntax, optimization)

If `chroma_mcp` is not available in the environment, fall back to `references/tool-gotchas.md` and the AMC SQL essentials section below.

## Knowledge retrieval modes

Two complementary patterns. Choose based on what you know.

### Mode A: Semantic search

When you don't yet know which document you want.

```
chroma_mcp:chroma_query_documents
  collection_name: "amazon_ads"
  query_texts: ["natural language query"]
  n_results: 5
```

**Response shape — unwrap `data` first.** The server returns `{"data": {ids, documents, metadatas, distances, included}, "meta": {collection, query, n_results}}`. Walking `r["documents"]` directly returns empty; you have to walk `r["data"]["documents"][0]`. Defensive pattern (survives a future envelope change):

```python
payload = res.get("data", res)        # unwraps current envelope, no-op if removed
docs = payload["documents"][0]        # outer list is per-query; index 0 for single query
metas = payload["metadatas"][0]
dists = payload["distances"][0]
```

`res["meta"]` carries the collection name, the query echo, and `n_results`.

**Always check `distances`.** Lower is better. Discard hits at distance > ~0.85 — they're noise. See `references/chroma-knowledge-base.md` for the full distance interpretation guide.

### Mode B: Metadata-driven retrieval

When you know the doc you want, or you need the *whole* playbook in order rather than a few semantically-matched chunks.

```
chroma_mcp:chroma_get_documents
  collection_name: "amazon_ads"
  where: {"semantic_id": "off-amazon-conversions"}
  limit: 200
```

This pulls every chunk of a known document deterministically. Same response envelope as Mode A — walk `res["data"]["documents"]` (one-level list here, since there's no per-query nesting). Useful filter keys: `semantic_id`, `source_ref`, `doc_type` (`howto` / `analysis` / `reference` / `schema`), `dataset`, `code_languages`. Composite filters use MongoDB-style `$and` / `$or`.

### Recommended hybrid workflow

1. Start with semantic search at `n_results: 5`
2. Inspect distances; reject anything > ~0.85
3. Read the metadata of the best hit and grab its `semantic_id`
4. Walk the full doc with `chroma_get_documents` filtered on that `semantic_id`

This is far more reliable than running 5–10 sequential semantic queries hoping to assemble the same content. The largest document in the collection has 220 chunks — semantic search alone will never give you all of it.

**Catalog of available documents, validated query phrasings, distance baselines, and `where`-filter recipes:** see `references/chroma-knowledge-base.md`.

## Pre-Flight Setup

Before any AMC API call, establish context. One identity may scope a single instance or dozens — branch on that early.

### Always

1. `get_session_state` — probe transport scope before relying on prior context. If `state_scope == 'request'` or `state_reason` is non-null (`"no_mcp_session"`, `"token_swapped"`, `"bridge_unavailable"`), re-establish identity / region / profile in this block. If `state_scope == 'session'` and `state_reason` is null, prior `set_active_*` calls still ride. Probe is read-only with no side effects; one probe per execute block is sufficient.
2. `set_active_identity` — choose advertising identity (only if the probe says you need to)
3. `set_region` — API region (NA / EU / FE)
4. `enable_tool_group` with `amc` — if AMC tools aren't visible

### Single-instance fast path

If the user already knows the instance / profile they want, continue from the Always sequence:

5. `ac_listProfiles` → `set_active_profile` — get profileId, marketplaceId, advertiserId
6. `amc_listInstances` — confirm instance `creationStatus: COMPLETED`
6b. `amc_getInstance` — inspect `advertiserTypes`. **`["SPONSORED_ADS"]` only → no `dsp_*` tables.** Writing SQL against `dsp_impressions` or `dsp_clicks` on an SP-only instance returns "table not found" or silently empty results.
7. `cm_QueryCampaign` with `adProductFilter: SPONSORED_PRODUCTS` — verify the entity owns campaigns

### Portfolio / agency fan-out

If the identity manages multiple brands (an agency identity often does), enumerate before picking:

```
set_active_identity (once)
  → ac_ListAdsAccounts                       # enumerate accounts
  → for each account/country:
       set_active_profile to that profile
       amc_listInstances(entity, marketplace)
  → present candidates to the user, let them pick
```

Without this, an agent will grab the first reachable instance and assume it's "the" one. Discovery itself does **not** require terms acceptance — that's only enforced on per-instance reads.

### Confirm before running — three-name reconciliation

`accountName` (from `ac_ListAdsAccounts`), profile name (from `ac_listProfiles` — `set_active_profile` is the setter, the name is on the listing response), and instance `customerCanonicalName` (from `amc_getInstance`) can all differ for multi-brand sellers. Display all three so the user can catch a mismatch:

```
You're about to query:
  ads account name      : Zesty Paws LLC
  profile name          : Zenwise Health      ← differs from account
  instance customerName : Zenwise Health
  instanceId            : amctfvm5gmh
```

## Core Workflow: Query → Execute → Results

### Step 1 — Find or write the query

If the user's request maps to a known playbook or template, query Chroma first (see "Knowledge retrieval modes" above). Otherwise compose SQL from the AMC SQL essentials below.

### Step 2 — Create workflow

**Before creating, check whether the workflow already exists.** Call `amc_listWorkflows` and look for a matching `workflowId` (or descriptive-name pattern). Re-using an existing workflow avoids polluting the instance with near-duplicate definitions, lets you skip straight to Step 3 (Execute), and — when the original was carefully tuned — preserves the suppression-strategy / parameter shape an earlier session already validated. Only create a new workflow when the user genuinely wants a new analysis or the existing one has a bug that's faster to replace than to update.

```
amc_createWorkflow
  workflowId: "descriptive_name"
  sqlQuery: "SELECT ..."
  instanceId: "<instance ID>"
  Amazon-Advertising-API-AdvertiserId: "<entity ID>"
  Amazon-Advertising-API-MarketplaceId: "<marketplace ID>"
  privacyFilteringBehavior: "REMOVE_VALUES"
```

This is the minimal shape. Other top-level params (`filteredMetricsDiscriminatorColumn`, `inputParameters`, `inputSchema`, `outputColumns`, `outputFormat`) are valid but optional. **Common wrong kwargs** that look right but fail validation (`distinctUserCountColumn`, `ignoreDataGaps`, `workflow:{...}` alongside `workflowId`) are catalogued in `references/tool-gotchas.md` → Workflow Creation. When in doubt, run `amazon_ads:get_schema` for the operation rather than guess.

**Parameterised queries — `CUSTOM_PARAMETER` ↔ `inputParameters` coupling.** If the SQL uses `CUSTOM_PARAMETER('foo')` placeholders, every named parameter must also be declared in `inputParameters[]` on create. Missing declarations don't fail at create time — they fail at *execute* time with `REJECTED` status and a vague parse error, often hours later if the execution was queued. See `references/tool-gotchas.md` → Workflow Creation for the declaration shape.

**Suppression strategy — pick one based on intent:**

- **HAVING floor (default for production analysis):** Put `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 100` (or 50 for small populations) in the SQL itself. This drops aggregation-threshold groups *before* the result is built — smaller file, no blanked `("","",N,M,X)` noise rows, no special-case handling downstream. Pair with `REMOVE_VALUES` and the floor wins.
- **`REMOVE_VALUES` alone (exploration / suppression visibility):** Use when you need to see *how much* is being suppressed — e.g., choosing whether to broaden a grouping. Keeps rows, nulls suppressed dimensions/metrics.
- **`REMOVE_ROWS` (default if you forget — avoid):** Drops entire rows that fail thresholds. Looks indistinguishable from empty data.

### Step 3 — Execute

```
amc_createWorkflowExecution
  workflowId: "descriptive_name"
  timeWindowType: "EXPLICIT"
  timeWindowStart: "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
  timeWindowEnd:   "2025-01-31T23:59:59"
```

The window MUST be a full datetime — date-only strings cause a 400. Use `dryRun: true` to validate syntax without running.

### Step 4 — Monitor

`amc_getWorkflowExecution` returns `status` as one of:

| Status | Meaning | Where the actionable text lives |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Queued, not yet running | — |
| `RUNNING` | Compute in progress | — |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Output is ready | `outputColumns` carries schema |
| `FAILED` | Compute started, then errored | `details[0].issue` / upstream message |
| `REJECTED` | Parse-time rejection (SQL syntax, unsupported function, schema mismatch) — distinct from FAILED. Observed in practice; not yet in the published OpenAPI. | `statusReason` carries the parse error verbatim — read it first |
| `CANCELLED` | Explicitly cancelled or system-aborted | `statusReason` carries the reason |

**For `REJECTED` and `CANCELLED`, prefer `statusReason` over `details[0].issue`** — the parse error is surfaced cleanly there, no envelope unwrapping needed. `REJECTED` paired with `Unsupported scalar operation type ||` or similar parse messages means fix the SQL; `dryRun: true` would have caught it before execution slot was burned.

**Don't use execution time alone to infer an empty result.** Execution time varies with column count, `COUNT(DISTINCT)` cardinality, join shape, and instance load far more than with infrastructure version — the same SQL can take 40 seconds on one instance and 7 minutes on another, both returning real data. Legacy "sub-60s = empty" no longer holds. The reliable test is **file size after download** (Step 5).

The `SUCCEEDED` response also contains an `outputColumns` array describing the result schema:

```
outputColumns: [
  {columnType: DIMENSION, dataType: STRING, name: "advertiser"},
  {columnType: DIMENSION, dataType: LONG,   name: "users_that_purchased"},
  {columnType: METRIC,    dataType: DECIMAL, precision: 38, scale: 17, name: "ntb_users_percentage"},
  ...
]
```

Read this *before* fetching the CSV so the selected execution environment can use correct dtypes, especially for high-scale DECIMAL fields where naive `float()` casting loses precision.

### Step 5 — Download and parse results

**Process results outside model context. Never pull the full CSV into the conversation.**

A 65 KB CSV through `read_download` may be tolerable; a 5 MB AMC export can exhaust context when the same content traverses a tool response, echo, and preview. Select an execution or file-processing facility from the tools the client actually exposes. It must be able to fetch HTTPS content, parse CSV, and return only a focused summary. If the client exposes no suitable facility, ask the user to download the export and provide it as a local file rather than streaming the full body through the conversation.

**Recommended pattern (direct fetch, no persistent copy):**

```
amc_getWorkflowExecutionDownloadUrls  → returns pre-signed S3 URLs (valid ~10 min)
available execution facility          → fetch the pre-signed URL, parse with csv/pandas,
                                         return ONLY a focused JSON summary
display summary to user
```

Use the equivalent of the following Python in the available execution facility. Prefer a structured handoff from the download-URL response instead of manually transcribing the URL; a single changed character invalidates its signature.

```python
import urllib.request, csv, io
# Read URL from the prior amc_getWorkflowExecutionDownloadUrls response object,
# never paste/transcribe it. Pre-signed URLs are 1.2+ KB of high-entropy base64;
# a single corrupted character (G→P is the canonical failure) breaks the
# signature and surfaces as S3 SignatureDoesNotMatch. See tool-gotchas.md.
url = download_urls_response["data"]["downloadUrls"][0]["url"]
raw = urllib.request.urlopen(url, timeout=30).read().decode("utf-8")

# Empty-result check before parsing: file size ≤ header line length = empty
header_line = raw.split("\n", 1)[0]
if len(raw.strip()) <= len(header_line):
    return {"row_count": 0, "note": "empty result"}

rows = list(csv.DictReader(io.StringIO(raw)))
# Return only what's needed — never the full table
return {
    "row_count": len(rows),
    "top_by_volume": sorted(rows, key=lambda r: -int(r["users_that_purchased"]))[:10],
    "suppressed_count": sum(1 for r in rows if not r["advertiser"]),
}
```

Stamped snippets for top-N, segment splits, weighted averages, percentile distributions, and period-over-period deltas live in `references/result-processing-templates.md`.

**Use `download_export` only when you need a persistent server-side copy** (re-running multiple analyses, sharing across sessions). Otherwise it's an unnecessary round-trip.

**URL expiry.** The response header includes `X-Amz-Expires=600` — URLs die after 10 minutes. If processing is queued, retried, or partially fails, re-call `amc_getWorkflowExecutionDownloadUrls` for a fresh URL rather than trying to reuse the expired one.

**Empty-result diagnostic (architecture-agnostic):** download the file and compare its size to the header-line length. File size ≤ header length = empty result. This replaces the old "67 bytes = empty" heuristic, which only worked for 4-column outputs.

Pre-signed S3 URLs cannot be fetched via `web_fetch`. Full pipeline details in `references/tool-gotchas.md`.

## AMC SQL Essentials

**Privacy:** All queries must aggregate. No `SELECT *`. Spend is microcurrency: `SUM(spend) / 100000000`. `user_id` only in COUNT / JOIN / WHERE — never in SELECT output (except audience queries, which must resolve to `SELECT DISTINCT user_id` against the `_for_audiences` table variants).

**Aggregation floor:** add `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 100` (or 50 for small populations) by default to drop suppressed groups at the source. See Step 2 for trade-offs against `REMOVE_VALUES`.

**Conditional aggregation is the canonical multi-segment idiom.** For any "X% of A who also are B" pattern (NTB%, frequency capping, cross-product overlap), aggregate conditionally off a single CTE rather than CTE+LEFT JOIN — same numbers, smaller plan, trivially extends to 3+ segments:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN new_to_brand = TRUE THEN user_id END) AS ntb_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN new_to_brand = TRUE THEN user_id END) * 1.0
    / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0) AS ntb_pct
FROM amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time
WHERE ...
```

**Not supported:** `LIMIT` (use `ROW_NUMBER()` in a subquery), `RIGHT JOIN` (swap to `LEFT JOIN`), `GETDATE()` (use `CAST('today' AS DATE)`), `||` string concat (use `CONCAT(a, b, c)`; the AMC parser rejects `||` with `Unsupported scalar operation type ||`).

**For SQL dialect, functions, CASE expressions, string filtering, optimization:** query Chroma — `introduction-to-amc-sql` (62 chunks), `amc-sql-reference` (5 chunks), `optimize-amc-sql-queries` (21 chunks), and `filter-text-strings` (3 chunks) cover the full reference. See `references/chroma-knowledge-base.md` for query phrasings.

## Troubleshooting

**Empty results** — most common failure mode:

1. Downloaded file size ≤ header line length → empty result (the reliable test)
2. Execution time alone is a weak signal — real queries vary from 40s to 7+ minutes on the same instance. Always confirm with the file-size check, not the clock.
3. `cm_QueryCampaign` returns nothing → SA campaigns are on a different entity (seller vs vendor)
4. New instance → 48–72h SA backfill lag
5. Wrong date range → campaigns didn't run in window
6. SP-only instance, dsp_* table in SQL → "table not found" or silently empty; check `advertiserTypes` (preflight Step 5b)

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Aggregation threshold not met" | `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= N` or broaden grouping |
| 400 on execution | Use full datetime: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss` |
| 403 on AMC API | `set_active_identity` to refresh; verify entity matches instance |
| 403 "Terms and conditions must be accepted" | See terms acceptance flow below |
| `internal_error` with cryptic `details[0].issue` | Map via `references/error-envelope-cookbook.md` |
| Conversion counts low | Wait 14+ days (attributed_events) or 28+ days (conversions_all) |
| AMC tools not visible | `enable_tool_group` with `amc` |
| Pre-signed S3 URL fetch fails | Use the download pipeline (Step 5) |

For deeper guidance on aggregation thresholds, query Chroma for `data-aggregation-thresholds-amc`.

### Terms acceptance flow

**Symptom:** any `amc_*` read returns HTTP 403 with `upstream_message: "Terms and conditions must be accepted to continue."` Discovery (`amc_listInstances`) is unaffected — terms are enforced per-instance on reads, not on listing.

**Diagnosis:** call `amc_AmcpLinkGetTermsV2` with the active advertiser entity. Returns `{hasAccepted, agreementToken, agreementContent}`.

**Resolution:** if `hasAccepted: false` **and the user explicitly authorizes acceptance**, call `amc_AmcpLinkSetTermsAcceptanceV2` with the returned `agreementToken` and `hasAccepted: true`.

This is a binding legal action. Never auto-accept. When the identity is an agency acting on behalf of a customer (e.g., agency seat managing a brand's data), surface the relationship — the agency would be accepting on the advertiser's behalf — and let the user confirm before flipping the flag.
