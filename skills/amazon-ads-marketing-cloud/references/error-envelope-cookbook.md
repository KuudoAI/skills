# Error Envelope Cookbook

`amazon_ads_mcp` now emits two distinct envelope shapes depending on where in the request lifecycle the failure occurred. The good shape (`mcp_input_validation`) is self-describing and actionable. The legacy shape (`internal_error`) is still overloaded across multiple precondition / sandbox / upstream failures and requires inspecting `details[0]` to recover the actual cause.

## Shape 1 — `mcp_input_validation` (good — self-describing)

Surfaces when the MCP server's schema-validation middleware rejects a tool call before dispatching to business logic. Stable `error_code`, fuzzy-match hints, exact problem statement — diagnose and fix in one round.

```json
{
  "error_kind": "mcp_input_validation",
  "summary": "Tool input validation failed.",
  "details": [{
    "path": "",
    "issue": "Additional properties are not allowed ('distinctUserCountColumn' was unexpected)",
    "received_type": "ValidationError"
  }],
  "hints": [
    "Remove unknown key distinctUserCountColumn or check schema for typos.",
    "Did you mean: distinctUserCountColumn → metric.userFrequency1, metric.userFrequency2, ...?",
    "Check required fields and input types in the tool schema."
  ],
  "error_code": "SCHEMA_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES",
  "retryable": false,
  "_envelope_version": 1
}
```

Observed `error_code` values: `SCHEMA_REQUIRED` (missing required field), `SCHEMA_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES` (unknown kwarg), `SCHEMA_TYPE_MISMATCH` (wrong type for a known field). Read `hints[]` first — it's the curated action list. The `Did you mean` hint is fuzzy-matched against the live schema.

## Shape 2 — `internal_error` (legacy — overloaded)

Still emitted for precondition failures, sandbox-runtime exceptions, and upstream Amazon errors. The real cause is in `details[0].issue` / `details[0].code`, not in the top-level `error_kind` or generic `hints: ["Inspect server logs."]`.

```json
{
  "error_kind": "internal_error",
  "error_message": "An internal error occurred",
  "details": [
    {
      "issue": "No active identity. Call set_active_identity first.",
      "code": "PRECONDITION_FAILED",
      "field": null
    }
  ],
  "upstream_status": 400,
  "upstream_message": null,
  "request_id": "abc-123"
}
```

Always inspect:
1. `details[0].issue` — the human-readable precondition message
2. `details[0].code` — stable error code (more reliable than `issue` text)
3. `upstream_status` / `upstream_message` — present when the failure happened at Amazon's edge, not in the MCP server
4. `request_id` — for support escalation only; not actionable

The top-level `error_kind` and `error_message` are intentionally generic in this shape and shouldn't drive logic. **When the server-side envelope work lands `precondition_failed` / `sandbox_runtime` / `auth_failed` as their own `error_kind` values, this cookbook can drop the per-row mapping below — the envelope will carry the action directly.**

## Precondition failures

These are MCP-server-local — Amazon never received the request.

| `details[0].issue` (or substring) | Root cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "No active identity" / "identity not set" | Identity ContextVar cleared between requests | Call `set_active_identity` first thing in the current execute block. See `tool-gotchas.md` → Identity persistence. |
| "No active profile" / "profile not set" | Profile not activated for the current identity | `ac_listProfiles` → `set_active_profile` with the right profileId / marketplaceId. |
| "advertiserTypes does not include DSP" / table-not-found on `dsp_*` | SP-only instance, SQL references DSP tables | Inspect `amc_getInstance.advertiserTypes`; if `["SPONSORED_ADS"]`, rewrite SQL to use only `sponsored_ads_*` and `amazon_attributed_events_by_*` tables. |
| "Schema mismatch" / "column not found" | SQL references a column that doesn't exist on this instance / dataset version | Query Chroma `chroma_query_documents("dataset table columns")` to confirm the live schema; the table reference docs in the `amazon_ads` collection are authoritative. |
| "Invalid time window format" | Date-only string in `timeWindowStart`/`End` | Use full datetime: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`. |

## Authorization failures

These are upstream — Amazon returned 401 / 403. `upstream_status` will be set.

| `upstream_message` (or substring) | Root cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "Terms and conditions must be accepted to continue" | Per-instance terms not accepted by this advertiser/entity | Run the terms acceptance flow (SKILL.md → Troubleshooting → Terms acceptance flow). Don't auto-accept. |
| "Access denied" / "Unauthorized advertiser" | Entity ID on the request doesn't match the entity that owns the instance | Re-run preflight: confirm `ac_listProfiles` returned the entity that actually owns the instance. Vendor and seller entities are distinct even under the same merchant account. |
| "Token expired" / 401 | Refresh token cycled mid-session | Re-call `set_active_identity` to mint a fresh access token. If the MCP refresh middleware is doing this automatically, this error indicates the upstream rejected the new token — check the refresh token in env. |

## Aggregation / privacy failures

| Symptom | Root cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "Aggregation threshold not met" | A `GROUP BY` produced a cell below the privacy threshold (typically 100 distinct users) | Add `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 100`; or broaden the grouping (e.g., remove a column from `GROUP BY`); or set `privacyFilteringBehavior: "REMOVE_VALUES"` to keep rows and null the suppressed values. |
| Empty result with no error | Real query ran, returned zero rows | Verify with the file-size check (`file size <= header line length` = empty). Then walk Empty Results troubleshooting in SKILL.md. |
| "Output contains raw user_id" | SQL has `user_id` in a SELECT list outside the audience query pattern | Move `user_id` to COUNT / JOIN / WHERE only. Audience queries are the exception — they must `SELECT DISTINCT user_id` from a `_for_audiences` table variant. |

## Execution failures

| Symptom | Root cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow `FAILED` with no result, `dryRun: false` | SQL parse error, or runtime error after execution started | Re-submit with `dryRun: true` — failures surface immediately at parse time without burning execution slots. |
| `RUNNING` for >30 minutes | Genuine long-running query (cross-join, no time filter, etc.) — or stuck | Check the SQL for missing time window in WHERE clauses, missing JOIN keys, or accidental Cartesian products. AMC `optimize-amc-sql-queries` doc in Chroma covers the usual culprits. |
| Pre-signed URL fetch returns 403 / SignatureDoesNotMatch | URL expired (10-min limit) | Re-call `amc_getWorkflowExecutionDownloadUrls` for a fresh URL. Never reuse an expired URL. |

## Diagnostic flow

When a call fails:

1. Read `details[0].issue` and `details[0].code` first. Map to the rows above.
2. If `upstream_status` is set, the failure is at Amazon's edge — focus on auth / terms / entity-mismatch rows.
3. If neither maps, log `request_id` and the full envelope; surface to the user with the raw envelope (don't fabricate a guess).
4. **Don't retry blindly.** Most of these failures are precondition-deterministic — they will re-fail until the precondition is fixed. The exceptions are token-expired (auto-retried by the MCP refresh middleware) and stuck-running (re-submit with `dryRun: true` to confirm parse-time validity before re-running).

## What this cookbook does not cover

Anything dynamic about the upstream Amazon AMC API — that's documented by Amazon and changes independently. This file covers only the MCP-server-mediated envelope shapes that the `amc` skill consistently encounters. If a new error shape appears, add it here with the action.
