# Attachments

Used by `sendInvoice`, `CreateWarranty`, and `createLegalDisclosure`, which
require files, and optionally by `confirmCustomizationDetails` and
`createDigitalAccessKey`. Up to 5 files per message.

The flow crosses two places. **The MCP server** creates the upload
destination and sends the message. **The host** (your shell) reads the file,
computes its hash, and uploads it: the code-mode `execute` sandbox is
restricted (no dynamic imports, no filesystem), so do file work outside it.
If the host has no shell, attachments aren't possible from this client.
Say so, and offer the text types, or point the seller to Seller Central's
Buyer-Seller Messages to attach the file by hand.

## Before uploading

- **Get the file from the seller**: a local path they give you. Never
  generate an invoice, warranty, or legal document yourself and send it as
  if it came from them. You may help them draft one, but they approve the
  final file.
- **Check it against the type's constraints** in `_embedded.actions[]` from
  `getMessagingActionsForOrder` (accepted formats, size, count). PDF is the
  safe default for documents; images suit customization proofs.
- **Language:** any text in the file must be in the buyer's `locale`
  language. If it isn't, tell the seller before uploading.
- **The file name shown to the buyer** is the `fileName` you send with the
  message, including the extension. It doesn't have to match the local file
  name, so make it clear, for example `Invoice-113-1234567-1234567.pdf`.

The upload happens only **after** the seller approves the preview (Step 5).
Include each attachment's display name and local path in the preview.

## Step A — Content-MD5 (host)

The Base64 of the raw MD5 digest, not the hex string:

```bash
openssl dgst -md5 -binary "/path/to/Invoice.pdf" | base64
# e.g. 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg==
```

## Step B — Create the upload destination (MCP)

`resource` is the message path for this order and type, **without** a
leading slash. Take it from the eligibility `href`: drop the leading `/` and
the query string.

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"id": SELLER_IDENTITY_ID})
r = await call_tool("uploads_createUploadDestinationForResource", {
    "marketplaceIds": ["ATVPDKIKX0DER"],
    "contentMD5": "1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg==",
    "resource": "messaging/v1/orders/113-1234567-1234567/messages/invoice",
    "contentType": "application/pdf",
})
d = r.get("payload", r)
return {"uploadDestinationId": d["uploadDestinationId"], "url": d["url"], "headers": d.get("headers", {})}
```

If the response lacks `uploadDestinationId` or `url`, stop and report it.
Never make up an ID or URL, and never send the message without its file.
The buyer would get a broken or empty attachment, and the message can't be
recalled.

The Uploads API's rate is 10 requests/second, burst 10. The `url` is a
short-lived, pre-signed S3 URL, so upload promptly. Hashes and destinations
are per file: two files need two destinations.

## Step C — Upload the file (host)

`PUT` the exact bytes to `url`, with every header from `headers`:

```bash
curl --fail -sS -X PUT \
  -H "Content-MD5: 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg==" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/pdf" \
  --upload-file "/path/to/Invoice.pdf" \
  "<url from Step B>"
```

Include any other header names returned in `headers` as well. Quote the URL,
because it contains `&`. A 200 means the upload worked. A 403 `SignatureDoesNotMatch`
or `BadDigest` usually means a header mismatch or a changed file: recompute
the MD5 and create a new destination. Don't reuse the old one.

## Step D — Send with the attachment (MCP)

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"id": SELLER_IDENTITY_ID})
await call_tool("messaging_sendInvoice", {
    "amazonOrderId": "113-1234567-1234567",
    "marketplaceIds": ["ATVPDKIKX0DER"],
    "attachments": [{"uploadDestinationId": d_id, "fileName": "Invoice-113-1234567-1234567.pdf"}],
})
```

For a batch of invoices, run Steps A–C for every file first, then one paced
send block (see [tool-access.md](tool-access.md)). A failed upload drops
only that order from the batch; report it.
