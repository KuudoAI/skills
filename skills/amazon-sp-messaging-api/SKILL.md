  Send order-scoped messages from an Amazon seller to a buyer with the SP-API
  Messaging API: check which message types an order allows, pick the right
  one, draft the text in the buyer's language within Amazon's content rules,
  attach invoices, warranties, or legally required documents, and send only
  after the seller approves an exact preview. Handles one order or a batch.
  Use whenever a seller wants to contact, notify, or message a buyer about an
  order: a delay or unexpected problem, confirming customization, delivery
  scheduling, an order question before shipping, a Home Services visit, a
  digital access key, or sending an invoice, warranty, or legal disclosure,
  even if they only say "let the customer know" or "email the buyer". Do not
  use for requesting reviews or seller feedback (Solicitations API), reading
  or replying to the buyer-seller inbox, marketing or promotional messages,
  A-to-z claims, returns, refunds, or Vendor (1P) orders.
license: PolyForm-Shield-1.0.0 (see LICENSE.txt)
compatibility: Requires an SP-API MCP server exposing the Messaging API v1 operations, plus Orders to look up orders. Attachments also need the Uploads API createUploadDestinationForResource and a host shell (curl, openssl) to upload the file to the returned URL. The seller's app needs the Buyer Communication role. Without a server the skill can only draft and explain.

# Amazon buyer messaging

Every message this skill sends is emailed to a real buyer the moment the call
succeeds. It cannot be recalled or edited, and the API has no way to read
back what was sent. Amazon also polices buyer messages closely: the wrong
message type, or text with marketing, a stray link, or a review request, can
put the seller's account at risk. So the job is:

- Do the plumbing yourself: find the order, check which message types it
  allows, get the buyer's language, and draft the text.
- Never send anything the seller has not seen word for word and approved.

Scope: Seller (3P) orders on the Messaging API v1, in NA, EU, and FE. Vendor
(1P) orders have no buyer messaging through this API.

## What this API can and can't do

It **sends proactive, order-scoped messages of a fixed set of types**. That
is all. Set expectations early when the request doesn't fit:

| The seller asks to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| Tell a buyer about a delay, backorder, or problem with the order | `createUnexpectedProblem` |
| Ask a question needed to ship the order | `createConfirmOrderDetails` |
| Arrange delivery or confirm delivery contact details | `createConfirmDeliveryDetails` |
| Confirm personalization (names, initials, images) | `confirmCustomizationDetails` |
| Schedule a Home Services visit | `createConfirmServiceDetails` |
| Send a code or key needed for digital content | `createDigitalAccessKey` |
| Send an invoice, warranty, or legally required document | `sendInvoice`, `CreateWarranty`, `createLegalDisclosure` (file-only) |
| **Read** buyer messages, or **reply** to a buyer's message | Not possible: the SP-API has no inbox. Say so, and point to Seller Central's Buyer-Seller Messages. There, a reply keeps the thread together and counts toward the 24-hour response time. Give the seller a paste-ready reply that follows [the content rules](references/content-rules.md). If the news also fits a type above, offer to send it as a separate proactive message |
| Ask for a review or seller feedback | Out of scope. Amazon's Solicitations API handles this, one request per order. Never put a review request in a message |
| Send a thank-you, promotion, coupon, cross-sell, or newsletter | Not allowed by Amazon. Decline and say why |

Full per-type details (text limits, attachments, when each type is
appropriate, and misuse to avoid) are in
[references/message-types.md](references/message-types.md). Read the entry
for the chosen type before drafting.

## 1. Connect to the tools

Operations are named by their Amazon `operationId`. On a code-mode SP-API
MCP server (top-level tools `search`, `get_schema`, `execute`):

- Messaging tools are `messaging_<operationId>`, for example
  `messaging_getMessagingActionsForOrder`. Note Amazon's own casing:
  `messaging_GetAttributes` and `messaging_CreateWarranty` start with a
  capital letter. The upload tool is
  `uploads_createUploadDestinationForResource`. Order lookup uses
  `orders_getOrders`, `orders_getOrder`, and `orders_getOrderItems`.
- Call them inside `execute` with `await call_tool(name, params)`. Body
  fields (`text`, `attachments`, `coverageStartDate`, `coverageEndDate`) are
  flattened into top-level arguments next to `amazonOrderId` and
  `marketplaceIds`.
- `marketplaceIds` takes **exactly one** marketplace: the one the order was
  placed in.
- Read the schema with `get_schema(tools=[…], detail="full")` before the
  first send of each type. The schema is the authority if it disagrees with
  this skill.
- **Select the seller** at the top of every `execute` block that touches
  seller data. Ask which seller unless the user already said; never pick one
  yourself.

Other servers use other prefixes; use whatever their discovery returns. If
`search("getMessagingActionsForOrder")` finds nothing, the server doesn't
expose Messaging: stop and tell the user to enable the Messaging operations
(and Uploads, for attachments) in their server's configuration. Connection details, identity selection,
response shapes, and errors are in
[references/tool-access.md](references/tool-access.md).

## 2. Workflow

### Step 1 — Pin down the order(s)

Use the Amazon order ID if the seller gave one (format `###-#######-#######`).
Otherwise find it with `orders_getOrders` or `orders_getOrder` from what they
describe (date range, SKU, status). You need the order ID, its marketplace,
its status, and the items. You do **not** need the buyer's name, email, or
address: don't request buyer PII (`getOrderItemsBuyerInfo`, restricted
data tokens). Amazon addresses the message; the text can say "Hello" without
a name.

For a batch ("message everyone whose order is delayed"), build the order list
first and show it to the seller before drafting anything.

### Step 2 — Check eligibility and language

For each order, in the order's marketplace:

1. `messaging_getMessagingActionsForOrder`: the message types this order
   allows **right now**. Availability depends on order status, fulfillment
   channel, seller type, and how many messages were already sent. The list
   is the only source of truth; don't assume a type is available because the
   order looks similar to another.
2. `messaging_GetAttributes`: `buyer.locale`, the buyer's preferred language
   (for example `en-US`, `de-DE`, `ja-JP`).

If the type you need is **not** in the list, say so plainly and leave that
order out of the send. Don't reach for another type just to get the message
through. Using `createUnexpectedProblem` for something that isn't a
problem, for example, is exactly the kind of misuse Amazon flags. An
available type is a legitimate alternative only when the message honestly
fits **that type's own purpose** in
[references/message-types.md](references/message-types.md). For example, a
question the seller must have answered before shipping fits
`createConfirmOrderDetails`. Offer such an alternative as a separate,
explicit choice for the seller. Never fold it silently into an approval.

### Step 3 — Pick the type

Match the seller's purpose to exactly one type using the table above and
[references/message-types.md](references/message-types.md). If the purpose
fits none of them, decline and explain; don't stretch a type to cover it.

### Step 4 — Draft within the rules

Write the text, or check the seller's text, against both the schema and
Amazon's content rules. The schema's own `text` description says: only links
related to the purpose of that message type; no HTML; no email addresses;
written in the buyer's language of preference.

Before previewing, check the draft against
[references/content-rules.md](references/content-rules.md). The short
version:

- **Length:** within the type's limit (800 for customization, 400 for a
  digital access key, 2000 for the others). Count characters, not words.
- **Language:** the buyer's `locale`. If it differs from the seller's
  language, draft in the buyer's language and show the seller a translation
  next to it in the preview.
- **Purpose only:** say what's needed to complete the order or fix the
  problem, and nothing else. No marketing, discounts, other products,
  "thank you for your purchase" padding, or requests for reviews, feedback,
  or ratings, however soft ("let us know how we did").
- **No contact redirection:** no email addresses, phone numbers, or links
  to the seller's own site, social media, or anything outside the order.
- **Plain text:** no HTML, and no images or logos in the text.
- **Seller-supplied text:** if it breaks a rule, don't send it as-is. Show
  what breaks which rule and offer a compliant rewrite.

Attachment-only types (`sendInvoice`, `CreateWarranty`,
`createLegalDisclosure`) take no text. The file carries the content, and any
text in the file must be in the buyer's language.

### Step 5 — Preview and get explicit approval

Show the seller exactly what will be sent, and wait for a clear go-ahead
("send", "yes, send it"). An earlier "go ahead and handle it" is not
approval of text they haven't seen.

**When the seller already approved.** If the seller supplied the exact final
text, named the orders, and told you to send it, that counts as approval,
provided your checks change nothing a buyer would receive. Send without
asking again, then report. Skipping an order whose type isn't available
doesn't change what the others get: send the rest and report the skipped
one. Anything else you had to change breaks that approval: translating,
removing content, shortening, or picking a different type than the one
they named. Preview the changed version and ask. Approval never covers
text that breaks the content rules; see Step 4.

**Single order:**

```
Order:        113-1234567-1234567 (Amazon.com, US)
Message type: Unexpected problem (createUnexpectedProblem)
Language:     en-US
Attachments:  none
Text (412 / 2000 chars):
  <exact text>
Reply "send" to send this message. It is emailed to the buyer immediately
and cannot be recalled.
```

**Batch:** one preview, one approval. List every order with its type,
language, and the **fully rendered** text for that order; don't show a
template with placeholders. Group identical texts to keep it readable, but
make the order count per group explicit. Name any orders that were dropped
(type not available, missing data) and why. The approval covers exactly the
listed orders and texts; if anything changes, preview again.

### Step 6 — Send

- Upload attachments first, if any. Follow
  [references/attachments.md](references/attachments.md).
- Call the send tool with `amazonOrderId`, `marketplaceIds` (one ID), and
  the body fields. HTTP 201 with an empty body means Amazon accepted the
  message and will email the buyer.
- **Pace sends at 1 per second** (Messaging's rate is 1 request/second,
  burst 5). In a batch, send sequentially in one `execute` block with a
  sleep between calls, and collect a per-order result. Don't fan out.
- On `429`, wait and retry that order once or twice with backoff.
- **Never blind-retry a send after a timeout or 5xx.** There's no way to
  check whether it went out, and a duplicate message annoys the buyer and
  counts against the order's message volume. Mark it "unknown: check Seller
  Central's sent messages" and let the seller decide.
- `400`, `403`, and `404` are final for that order: report the error text.
  `403` usually means the app lacks the Buyer Communication role for this
  seller, or the message type isn't allowed for this order.

### Step 7 — Report

End with a short per-order table: order ID, type, result (sent / failed with
reason / unknown / skipped with reason). Buyer replies arrive in Seller
Central's Buyer-Seller Messages, not through this API.

## Account-level notes

- Messaging needs the **Buyer Communication** role on the seller's app
  authorization. A consistent `403` across every order means the role is
  missing, not that each order is ineligible.
- Amazon lists `createUnexpectedProblem` for NA and FE only. In EU
  marketplaces, expect it to be missing from the eligibility list.
- Buyers can opt out of non-critical messages, and Amazon enforces that.
  Never choose a "critical" type (unexpected problem, legal disclosure) to
  reach a buyer who would otherwise not get the message.
