  Design and run an Amazon repricing strategy from live SP-API data: compute
  per-SKU floors from real fee estimates, diagnose why the Featured Offer (Buy
  Box) is being lost, segment the catalog, write rules and guardrails, and
  produce a reviewable price change-set. IF the user is losing the Buy Box,
  asks what price to set, wants a repricing strategy or repricing rules, is in
  a price war or being undercut, needs a floor or break-even price, asks about
  Automate Pricing or a third-party repricer, or mentions ANY_OFFER_CHANGED,
  featured offer expected price, getCompetitivePricing, or Buy Box percentage
  — THEN invoke this skill. It proposes price changes and validates them
  before any write, and never applies prices unattended. DO NOT invoke for
  advertising bids or ad budgets (that is amazon-budget-pacing), listing copy
  or images, inventory forecasting, or returns analysis.
compatibility: Amazon SP-API MCP (meta-tool pattern) for pricing, fees, listings, and reports. Degrades to advisory mode without it, where floors and competitive position depend entirely on seller-supplied figures.

# Amazon repricing

Repricing is usually framed as "what price wins the Buy Box". That framing is
what produces price wars. The useful framing is two questions in order:
**what is the lowest price this SKU can afford, and is winning at that price
worth it?** A repricer that cannot answer the first question is just a machine
for giving away margin quickly.

So the work is: compute floors from real fees, find out what is actually
costing the Featured Offer, apply different rules to genuinely different parts
of the catalog, and hand back a change-set a human approves.

## Start from data, not a questionnaire

Most repricing advice opens by asking the seller for numbers the API already
has. Pull them instead. It is faster, it is accurate, and it means the
conversation is about decisions rather than data entry.

| What you need | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| Current prices and the working SKU set | Merchant listings report |
| Who else is on the ASIN, at what landed price | `getItemOffers` / `getCompetitivePricing`, batched |
| Whether you hold the Featured Offer now | The offer response's featured buying options |
| Featured-offer share over time | Sales and traffic business report, needs the Brand Analytics role |
| Fees at a candidate price | `getMyFeesEstimateForASIN` / `ForSKU` |
| The price that would win | `getFeaturedOfferExpectedPriceBatch`, 40 SKUs per call |
| Stock cover | FBA Inventory API or an inventory report |
| Competitor moves as they happen | `ANY_OFFER_CHANGED` notification, if a pipeline exists |

Operation names shift, so discover them through the SP MCP meta-tools and read
the schema before the first call. Details, batch sizes, and the constraints
that shape the design: [`references/01-sp-api-surfaces.md`](references/01-sp-api-surfaces.md).

**What to ask the seller for** is the part the API genuinely cannot answer:
landed cost of goods, the minimum contribution they will accept, storage cost,
return rate, whether a SKU only sells with ad support, and any SKU that must
be excluded for promotional or contractual reasons. Ask for these once,
together, and record which figures you were given versus assumed.

## The floor is computed, never guessed

A catalog-wide "keep 20% margin" is wrong almost everywhere, because referral
fees scale with price while fulfillment fees scale with size and weight. Two
SKUs at the same price have different break-evens, and one SKU has a different
break-even at two different prices.

Compute per SKU, evaluating fees **at the candidate price** rather than the
current one. The fee API will estimate for a price you have not set yet, which
is what makes this possible. Break-even and floor are different numbers: floor
is break-even plus the contribution the seller actually wants, and that margin
is a business decision to ask about rather than assume.

The three inputs people leave out, and the reason a "profitable" floor still
produces a bad quarter: storage, returns, and advertising allocation. Full
arithmetic in [`references/02-floor-and-margin.md`](references/02-floor-and-margin.md).

Set a ceiling too. Without one, a follow-the-competitor rule can walk a
listing upward into a fair-pricing problem or into having no Featured Offer at
all.

## The Featured Offer is not an auction

Lowest price does not win it. Eligibility comes first, and then Amazon weighs
landed price, fulfillment and delivery speed, availability, and seller
performance together.

Three consequences that change what you should do:

- **Landed price, not item price.** A merchant-fulfilled competitor with paid
  shipping competes at its total. Reading item prices off an offer list is the
  most common way to misjudge a competitive set.
- **Matching an FBA competitor from a merchant-fulfilled offer usually
  loses.** The gap you must close is not zero and is often wider than your
  margin. Where that is true, say so: the answer is a fulfillment change or
  not competing on that ASIN, not another price cut.
- **Nobody winning is a different problem from someone else winning.** Amazon
  can suppress the Featured Offer entirely when no offer is priced
  competitively. That calls for a move toward the reference price, not a fight
  with a rival.

Diagnosis, eligibility gates, offer rotation, and how to infer a target price
where expected-price data is unavailable:
[`references/03-featured-offer.md`](references/03-featured-offer.md).

## Segment, then apply rules

One rule across 200 SKUs is the signature of a strategy that will lose money
somewhere. Split the catalog on competitive structure crossed with margin
headroom first, since both are computable from what you already pulled, then
refine with inventory cover and velocity.

| Archetype | When |
|---|---|
| Hold | Sole seller or brand-controlled ASIN. Nothing to match |
| Match | Comparable competitor and you hold a fulfillment advantage |
| Beat by increment | Comparable competitor, no fulfillment edge. Small absolute increments, never a percentage |
| Target expected price | Marketplace supports it, subject to floor |
| Seek high | You hold the offer uncontested. Walk price up until you lose it, then step back |
| Stock-out defence | Cover is short and replenishment is far. Price up |

**Seek-high is the one most sellers are missing.** A repricer that only moves
downward converts an advantage into a discount. Holding the Featured Offer
uncontested means the current price is a floor on what the market will bear.

Guardrails that keep a wrong decision cheap: per-SKU floor, ceiling, maximum
change per cycle, cooldown between changes on the same SKU, minimum increment,
and an exclusion list. Patterns, cadence, and anti-patterns:
[`references/04-rule-design.md`](references/04-rule-design.md).

## Breaking the race to the bottom

Two automated repricers set to undercut each other reach both floors within
hours, and both sellers hold the share they started with at minimum margin.
Three things prevent it, and they only work together: a real floor, a cooldown
so you are not chasing your own move reflected back, and a comparable-offers
filter.

The filter is the piece usually missing. Before picking a target price, drop
used and refurbished offers when you sell new, offers that cannot currently
fulfil, sellers whose delivery promise is far worse than yours, and offers
whose landed price makes them uncompetitive anyway. What remains is much
smaller than the raw list, and undercutting anything outside it is spending
margin against an offer that was never going to win.

## Writing prices safely

Prices are money, and an automated price change is the fastest way to lose it
at scale. **Propose a change-set and have a human approve it.** Apply
unattended only when the user has explicitly set up that arrangement.

Before writing anything, run the proposed change through `patchListingsItem`
with `mode=VALIDATION_PREVIEW`. It surfaces pricing problems, including
Featured Offer disqualification and pricing policy violations, without
applying the change. Report what it returns, because a validated change-set
and an unchecked one are different things and the seller should know which
they are approving.

Single updates go through `patchListingsItem` on the `purchasable_offer`
attribute; large change-sets go through the JSON listings feed. Every proposed
price is reported next to its floor and the rule that produced it, or it is
not reviewable.

## Measure the pair, not the headline

Featured-offer share on its own will make a bad strategy look good. Report it
beside contribution per unit, always. Share up with contribution down means
you bought the offer at a price you should not have. Share flat with
contribution up means the floor discipline is working and you were previously
giving margin away.

Deliverable shape: [`references/05-report-template.md`](references/05-report-template.md).

## Honest limits

- **Expected price is an expectation, not a promise.** Amazon states the
  featured offer is not guaranteed, since competing offers move and fulfillment
  capability to a given customer can decide it. Check marketplace availability
  and eligibility rather than assuming, and where it is unavailable say plainly
  that the target was inferred from the offer set.
- **Featured-offer share needs the Brand Analytics role.** Without it you can
  see current standing but not whether last month improved.
- **Event-driven repricing needs a notification pipeline** the seller has to
  operate. Without one, plan for scheduled pulls and reaction in hours, not
  minutes.
- **Rate limits and batch sizes make constant repricing of a large catalog
  impossible.** Tier the refresh by SKU value rather than pretending
  otherwise.
- **Competitive data is perishable.** A change-set built on an old pull may
  already be wrong; timestamp it.
- **Fee estimates are estimates.** They are far better than a guessed margin
  and still not an invoice.
