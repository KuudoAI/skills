# SP-API surfaces for repricing

What to pull, why, and where it comes from. Operation names move and Amazon
adds surfaces, so treat every name here as a starting point: discover the real
operation through the SP MCP meta-tools (`search`, then `get_schema`) before
the first call, and let the schema win when it disagrees with this file.

## Competitive and offer data

The Product Pricing API is the core read surface. It exists in a v0 family and
a newer 2022-05-01 family, and the newer batch operations are generally what
you want for a catalog of any size.

| Purpose | Operation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Your own listing's price and status | `getPricing` | By SKU or ASIN |
| Competitive summary for your listings | `getCompetitivePricing` | Accepts up to 20 SKUs or ASINs per call |
| Every offer on an ASIN | `getItemOffers` | The competitor set, with condition and fulfillment |
| Every offer on your listing | `getListingOffers` | Same, scoped to your SKU |
| Batch versions of the above | `getItemOffersBatch`, `getListingOffersBatch` | Fewer calls for a real catalog |
| Featured offer and reference prices, batched | `getCompetitiveSummary` | 2022-05-01 family |
| The price at which you would expect to win | `getFeaturedOfferExpectedPriceBatch` | Up to 40 SKUs; see the conditions below |

**Featured Offer Expected Price is the single most useful number for
repricing**, because it answers the question directly rather than making you
infer it from the offer list. Coverage expanded over time: an early rollout
covered a subset of European marketplaces, a later changelog extended it to all
marketplaces except Japan, and current documentation describes it as available
in all marketplaces. Confirm the seller's marketplace with `get_schema` or the
live docs rather than trusting any snapshot of that list, including this one.

The conditions that do hold: up to 40 SKUs per call, and items must be in new
condition, ship nationwide, and be eligible to become the featured offer.

Read it as an expectation, not a promise. It is the computed price at or below
which you can expect to become the featured offer, and Amazon states plainly
that the outcome is not guaranteed, because competing offers change and
fulfillment capability to a specific customer can decide the winner.

One deprecation worth knowing: `competitivePriceThreshold` was superseded when
the 2022-05-01 family introduced a new competitive price. Do not build new
logic on the deprecated field.

## Fees: the floor input

The Product Fees API returns estimated fees for an item, and it can be called
**for a price you have not set yet**. That is what makes a computed floor
possible rather than a guessed one.

| Purpose | Operation |
|---|---|
| Fee estimate for a candidate price, by ASIN | `getMyFeesEstimateForASIN` |
| Same, by seller SKU | `getMyFeesEstimateForSKU` |
| Batched | `getMyFeesEstimates` |

Feed it the price you are considering, not the price you have. The referral
fee scales with price, so the fee at your floor is not the fee at your current
price. Math in [`02-floor-and-margin.md`](02-floor-and-margin.md).

## Featured offer share over time

Real-time offer data tells you where you stand now. It does not tell you
whether you won the Featured Offer over the last month, which is the metric
that decides whether a strategy worked.

The Sales and Traffic business report carries a featured-offer (Buy Box)
percentage at ASIN and date granularity, via the Reports API with a
`reportType` in the sales-and-traffic family. Two conditions matter: access
requires the Brand Analytics role on the SP-API application, and the metric is
a share of page views rather than a count of wins, so read it as "what
fraction of the time were we the featured offer" and not as a conversion
number.

Confirm the current `reportType` string against Amazon's Report Type Values
page before hard-coding it, the same discipline the other SP-API skills in
this repo use. Report names get added and renamed.

## Catalog and inventory

Repricing needs to know what you sell and whether you can afford to sell it
faster.

- **Current listings and prices** come from a merchant listings report. Use it
  to establish the working set rather than calling pricing operations blindly
  across the whole catalog.
- **Inventory levels** come from the FBA Inventory API or an inventory report.
  Coverage changes the strategy: a SKU with three weeks of stock and a
  replenishment already inbound can afford to chase volume; a SKU with nine
  months of cover should not be discounted to move faster, and a SKU about to
  stock out should usually be priced *up*, not down.

## Notifications: the event-driven path

Polling a catalog for competitor changes is expensive and slow. The
event-driven path is what real repricers use.

**`ANY_OFFER_CHANGED`** fires when any of the top 20 offers on your item
changes by condition, when an external price changes, or when the Featured
Offer winner changes. The payload carries the offer set plus Buy Box prices
including landed price. It supports filtering by marketplace and aggregating
to one notification every five or ten minutes through a processing directive,
which is how you keep volume survivable on a large catalog.

**`PRICING_HEALTH`** fires on pricing-health problems, which is the signal
that a listing has been flagged rather than simply out-priced.

Both require notification infrastructure to be set up, typically an SQS queue
the application polls. That is a deployment concern, not something this skill
configures. If the seller has no notification pipeline, say so plainly and
work from scheduled pulls instead, accepting that the strategy will react in
hours rather than minutes.

## Writing prices

Two paths, and one safety feature that matters more than either.

- **Single item:** `patchListingsItem` on the Listings Items API, updating the
  `purchasable_offer` attribute. A single request can carry prices for several
  marketplaces.
- **Bulk:** the JSON listings feed through the Feeds API, for large change
  sets.

**The safety feature: `patchListingsItem` accepts `mode=VALIDATION_PREVIEW`.**
That previews the change and surfaces pricing issues, including Featured Offer
disqualification and pricing policy violations, without applying it. Use it on
every proposed change before anything is written. It converts "we found out
after the price went live" into a pre-flight check, and it costs nothing but a
call.

Amazon also exposes a surface for managing its own automated pricing rules
through the API, which is worth discovering with `search` if the seller wants
Amazon's native repricer driven programmatically rather than configured by
hand in Seller Central.

## Constraints that decide your design

These shape the strategy more than any rule you write, so establish them early.

| Constraint | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| FOEP availability and eligibility | Decides whether you get the target price directly or must infer it from the offer set |
| Brand Analytics role | Decides whether you can measure featured-offer share at all |
| Batch sizes (20 for competitive pricing, 40 for FOEP) | Decides call volume and how often a large catalog can refresh |
| Rate limits | A 5,000 SKU catalog cannot be repriced every minute; design the refresh tier by SKU value |
| Notification pipeline present or absent | Decides event-driven versus scheduled, minutes versus hours |
| Write path available | A read-only credential can still produce a change-set for a human to apply |
