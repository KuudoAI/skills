# SP-API data sources for returns

Use the client-configured Selling Partner API integration if live retrieval is
requested. Discover its native operations and schemas in the current session;
this skill does not define MCP server names or wrapper operations.

Verify report behavior against Amazon's current documentation before creating
application logic:

- [FBA report types](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/report-type-values-fba)
- [Returns report types](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/report-type-values-returns)
- [Reports API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/reports-api-v2021-06-30-reference)

## Choose by channel

| Channel | Report type | Documented role |
|---|---|---|
| FBA | `GET_FBA_FULFILLMENT_CUSTOMER_RETURNS_DATA` | Customer-returned items received at an Amazon fulfillment center, including reason and disposition. Updated daily; request-only; tab-delimited. |
| Seller-fulfilled | `GET_FLAT_FILE_RETURNS_DATA_BY_RETURN_DATE` | Return requests by return date, including return request, RMA, label, ASIN, and reason information. Requestable or schedulable; tab-delimited; up to 60 days per report. |

These reports are not interchangeable. The seller-fulfilled report does not
promise the FBA fields for fulfillment center, detailed disposition, status,
or customer comments. Inspect the actual document before mapping.

## Possible FBA denominator

`GET_FBA_FULFILLMENT_CUSTOMER_SHIPMENT_SALES_DATA` contains item-level shipped
FBA order data, including shipment date, ASIN, quantity, Amazon order ID, and
price fields. Amazon documents it as request-only and near-real-time in Europe,
Japan, and North America, with normal latency and occasional longer delays.

This report can support a same-window shipment denominator or an order-level
cohort join. It does not make returns-by-return-date divided by
shipments-by-shipment-date a cohort rate. See `computing-return-rate.md`.

For seller-fulfilled returns, select an order or shipment source whose channel,
marketplace, unit grain, and date definition match the numerator. Do not use an
FBA-only shipment denominator for seller-fulfilled returns.

## Live retrieval rules

1. Resolve the current seller account and marketplace using read-only data from
   the connected integration.
2. Inspect the operation schema, required roles, report options, status values,
   and date constraints instead of copying an example request.
3. Use ISO 8601 timestamps in the timezone required by the operation. State how
   a relative user window was resolved.
4. Preserve the report ID and poll with bounded backoff. Do not create a second
   report merely because the first is still processing.
5. Read report-document metadata to determine compression and character set.
   Do not infer either from the filename.
6. Treat document URLs as sensitive and short-lived. Download promptly through
   the client's supported mechanism without reproducing them in the response.
7. Record request scope, report type, creation time, completion state, document
   metadata, and actual data coverage as provenance.

## Required source distinctions

- FBA `return-date` records receipt of a returned item at a fulfillment center;
  it is not necessarily the refund date or return-request date.
- Seller-fulfilled return-request data describes the return process at a
  different event grain. Label metrics accordingly.
- A completed zero-row report is valid evidence of an empty result for the
  requested scope only after marketplace, channel, dates, and freshness are
  verified.
- Report availability, fields, roles, and limits can change. The current Amazon
  documentation and live schema take precedence over this bundled reference.
