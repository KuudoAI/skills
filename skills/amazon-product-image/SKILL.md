# Amazon product images

## Purpose

Create, revise, evaluate, or troubleshoot images intended for Amazon product listings. Preserve product truth, distinguish Amazon requirements from recommendations, and report only what the available evidence supports.

An image review is advisory. It does not certify marketplace acceptance, and this skill does not upload or replace listing images unless the user explicitly requests that separate action and the required Amazon connection is available.

## Establish scope

Identify the following before making category-sensitive claims:

- marketplace and product category or product type;
- image role: main, alternate, swatch, offer-listing photo, or another supported role;
- actual product, variant, quantity, and delivered contents;
- task mode: generate, edit, audit, or troubleshoot; and
- available evidence: source product images, candidate image bytes, file metadata, title/listing data, or an Amazon issue response.

Ask for a missing fact only when it changes the result. Otherwise proceed and mark the affected conclusion `Unable to determine`.

## Evidence hierarchy

Apply guidance in this order:

1. Current requirements for the user's marketplace, category, and listing workflow.
2. General Amazon image requirements in [policy and technical requirements](references/01-policy-and-technical-requirements.md).
3. Category-specific or dated guidance, clearly labeled with its scope and age.
4. Merchandising recommendations, which never override compliance requirements.

When sources conflict, use the higher tier and disclose the conflict. Do not silently convert archived guidance or a Seller Central interface observation into a universal current rule.

## Workflow

1. **Route the task.** Load only the references required by the image role, category, and task mode.
2. **Inspect evidence.** For an audit, view the original-resolution image and inspect available dimensions, format, color mode, and relevant listing facts. Verify measurable properties with tools instead of judging them by eye.
3. **Apply hard requirements first.** Check product identity, delivered quantity, technical validity, and role-specific restrictions before offering conversion improvements.
4. **Perform the requested work.**
   - For generation or editing, read [generation, editing, and audit](references/06-generation-editing-and-audit.md), then use the client's available image tool or provide a production-ready prompt when no tool is available.
   - For suppression, upload, display, or error `100239`, read [suppression and troubleshooting](references/03-suppression-and-troubleshooting.md).
   - For fashion, apparel, footwear, intimate apparel, swimwear, or beauty, read [fashion and beauty](references/05-fashion-and-beauty.md).
5. **Validate the result.** Reinspect generated or edited output at original resolution. Separate verified findings from conditions that require Seller Central, product evidence, or human review.
6. **Deliver a scoped result.** Use the response contract below and give exact remediation for every blocking issue.

## Response contract

Use one of these scoped outcomes:

- `Pass on inspected criteria` — every criterion that could be inspected passed; list any unverified criteria.
- `Needs changes` — one or more inspected criteria failed; list blocking issues before optional improvements.
- `Unable to determine` — essential evidence is missing; name the evidence required.
- `Amazon rejected` or `Amazon suppressed` — use only when the user provides an actual Amazon status or issue response.

Include:

```text
Outcome: [scoped outcome]
Scope: [marketplace, category, image role, and inspected evidence]
Verified findings:
- [finding, requirement class, and evidence]
Unverified criteria:
- [criterion and missing evidence]
Required fixes:
- [exact remediation]
Optional improvements:
- [merchandising suggestion]
References used:
- [reference filenames]
```

Keep required fixes separate from optional optimization. Preserve the user's source files and listing state unless they explicitly authorize a change.
