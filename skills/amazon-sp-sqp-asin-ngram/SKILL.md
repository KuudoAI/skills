# Amazon SQP / ASIN n-gram diagnostics

## Overview

Upgrade query-level organic analysis to **`{search_query, asin}`** diagnostics so recommendations can be SKU-specific (PDP, price, shipping, variants). This skill adds ASIN-level IF→THEN rules, decision JSON shape, guardrails, and **report QA** (hygiene, opportunity score, badges). Pair with **`ngram-keyword-framework`** for shared `data_mode` rules and query-level organic tables.

## When to Use

- Building or interpreting per-ASIN SQP exports (`search_query` + ASIN metrics)
- Recommending `seo_update`, `pdp_update`, `price_test`, `shipping_speed_fix`, `variant_mapping_fix` from share/CVR signals
- Ranking opportunities with a lift-aware composite score instead of volume-only sorts
- Hardening agent outputs with badges, attribution scope, and token hygiene

## Quick Start

1. Confirm **`data_mode`** is `organic` (or a clearly separated organic slice in `mixed`). Do not compute ACoS/ROAS from SQP totals + ad spend.
2. For each `(search_query, asin)`, assemble **market** totals, **asin_metrics** (shares, CTR, price, shipping distribution), **flags** (thin data, seasonal), and optional **`ngram_cluster_ids`**.
3. Check **minimum thresholds** (e.g. `total_impressions ≥ 200`, `asin_clicks ≥ 20`) or apply shrinkage before strong claims.
4. Match **IF→THEN** rules in `references/asin-rules.md`; emit **recommendations** as decision records with `[ORGANIC]` / `[OPS]` / `[ADS]` tags when suggesting cross-domain actions.
5. Apply **7–14 day cooldown** per `{search_query, asin}` unless metrics moved opposite intent.
6. For portfolio ranking, compute **RankScore** per `references/opportunity-score-and-qa.md`.

## Decision object (per `{search_query, asin}`)

```json
{
  "data_mode": "organic",
  "asin": "B00XYZ...",
  "search_query": "dog bed large",
  "market": {
    "total_impressions": 123456,
    "total_clicks": 3456,
    "purchase_rate": 0.018
  },
  "asin_metrics": {
    "impression_share": 0.024,
    "click_share": 0.031,
    "purchase_share": 0.020,
    "ctr": 0.041,
    "median_price": 39.99,
    "shipping_speed": {"same_day": 0.12, "one_day": 0.48, "two_day": 0.40}
  },
  "flags": {
    "thin_data": false,
    "seasonal_spike": false
  },
  "ngram_cluster_ids": ["large", "dog bed"],
  "recommendations": []
}
```

Populate `recommendations` with framework-aligned actions (see reference tables).

## Guardrails (summary)

- Enforce sufficiency before destructive or costly ops changes; state **attribution scope** (SQP is search-page scoped, short window).
- Use **confidence** and peer benchmarks where available (see main n-gram skill).
- Tag every action: `[ORGANIC]` PDP/title/bullets/variant; `[OPS]` shipping/fulfillment/badges/inventory; `[ADS]` sponsored tactics.

## Relationship to `ngram-keyword-framework`

- **Framework skill**: query-level n-gram rollups, Ads rulebook, organic query rulebook, mixed guardrails, SQL/intents.
- **This skill**: ASIN-scoped diagnostics, opportunity ranking, output hardening — load both when the user’s data is ASIN × query.
