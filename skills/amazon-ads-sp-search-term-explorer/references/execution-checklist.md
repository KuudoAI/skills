# Execution checklist (feature-complete run)

Use this before shipping the final markdown. Every box should be **done** or **N/A with reason**.

## Scope and inputs

- [ ] **SP-only** (or user explicitly merged non-SP — documented)
- [ ] **Data source** named (file path, table, API job, etc.)
- [ ] **Date range / `window_days`** stated (from date column max−min+1, file name, or user)

## Elicitation (before segment tables)

- [ ] **`threshold-elicitation.md`** four questions answered **or** user said “use defaults” (labeled in report)
- [ ] **`brand_markers`** captured **or** user opted out (warning in §1 + §9)

## Columns and attribution

- [ ] **`COLUMN_MAP`** documented (semantic role → actual header)
- [ ] **Attribution window** documented **or** **UNKNOWN** banner in deliverable
- [ ] **Cost present?** If no → **interest-only** mode; no spend negatives, no “historical waste” sum

## Streams and grain

- [ ] **ASIN-shaped** vs **customer-query** partition **before** keyword aggregation (regex + catalog note if extended)
- [ ] **Keyword stream** aggregated to one row per search term (sum additive metrics; ratios on totals)
- [ ] **ASIN stream** stats in portfolio summary and optional §7

## Sufficiency

- [ ] **Median clicks per term** (and definition: all terms vs clicks>0 only) reported
- [ ] **Window-aware + baseline gates** from `segment-rules.md` applied; **strict** negs refused when rules say so
- [ ] **Confidence** / degraded language on tables when marginal

## Segments (keyword stream)

- [ ] **§3 Negatives** — strict vs watchlist per gates; **historical waste in window** wording only
- [ ] **§4 Generic gold** and **§5 Branded gold** — **two tables**, never one undifferentiated “gold”
- [ ] **§6 Rising** — generic vs branded framing

## Deliverable

- [ ] **§0 Data scope** present
- [ ] **§1** thresholds, brand markers, attribution, **provenance** (file/table/report id as applicable)
- [ ] **§8 Recommendations** tie to terms and **keyword vs product target**
- [ ] **§9 Caveats** include sufficiency and re-run window advice

## Safety (human-in-the-loop)

- [ ] Remind user to **confirm match type, brand policy, and campaign context** before applying negatives in Amazon Ads console
- [ ] No **keyword** negative advice for **ASIN-format** strings
