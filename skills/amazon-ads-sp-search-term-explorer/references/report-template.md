# Search term gold miner — output template

Deliver as markdown. Replace hints with computed values or **N/A (reason)**.

**Ordering:** stop-the-bleeding first (negatives), then discovery wins (generic gold), then brand defense, then rising stars — matches typical agency workflow.

---

## 0) Data scope — what this report is **not**

State every run (this is **scope**, not a minor caveat):

- **Sponsored Products only** — search terms here are from **SP** click paths, not a full picture of all customer queries.
- **No zero-click queries** — terms with impressions but **no clicks** are typically **absent**; impression-only demand is invisible here.
- **Not Sponsored Brands / Sponsored Display / DSP** search terms — unless the user merged other files (say so).
- **Not organic** — organic queries require **Brand Analytics** / SQP / other sources, not this export alone.

---

## 1) Attribution, thresholds, brand markers, and provenance

- **ATTRIBUTION WINDOW:** `documented (…)` | `UNKNOWN` — if unknown, repeat the banner from `references/attribution-window.md` in prose. For **MCP-generated** SP reports using `metric.sales` / `metric.purchases` without a day suffix, state **Amazon v1 default** (often described as **~14-day** click-attributed for SP — confirm in current Amazon docs).
- **Thresholds used** — gold ACoS ceiling %, negative spend floor (currency), min clicks for strict negatives, min window (days); note if **elicited** vs placeholder.
- **Brand markers** — list of substrings/patterns the user supplied for **their** brand (used to split branded vs generic). If user declined, state **none — split not applied** and warn that gold mixes brand and generic. Collect **before** segment tables (ideally before large pulls or MCP `CreateReport`).
- **Provenance:** how this data was obtained — **always** include the **MCP `reportId`** + `datePeriod.startDate` / `datePeriod.endDate` + the `advertiserAccountId` (the `amzn1.ads-account.g.*` value). Include the active `profileId` if relevant for re-runs. Makes outputs auditable and reproducible against the exact report the MCP server produced.

## 2) Portfolio summary

- Data source, date range, marketplace, currency, aggregation rule (search term grain)
- Totals: spend (if cost mapped), sales, clicks, impressions, orders
- **Keyword stream vs ASIN-format stream:** count of rows / terms matching ASIN pattern vs not; **% of clicks or spend** on ASIN-format “terms” (if cost present)
- **Distribution:** median and/or percentile of **clicks per search term** after aggregation — drives sufficiency narrative
- **Sufficiency mode:** `full` | `degraded` | `interest-only` (cost missing) — one line from `segment-rules.md`
- Portfolio ACoS only when cost + sales + known attribution

---

## 3) Negative candidates (keyword stream only)

**Default:** exclude **ASIN-format** values from this table (they belong in product-targeting workflows). State exclusion rule.

- **Strict table** — only if sufficiency allows **strict** negatives (window + click floors met). Definition used.
- **Loose / watchlist table** — optional lower bar when strict is blocked; label **monitor, do not bulk negate**.
- Columns: search term, spend, clicks, sales, impressions, optional match type / campaign
- **Historical waste in window:** sum of **cost** for rows in this segment — label exactly: **“Historical waste in window (not future savings)”**.
  **Do not** use “potential,” “projected,” or “estimated future” for this number.
- **Annualized projection:** include **only** if analysis window **≥ 28 days** and user wants it; must say it **assumes** mix and bidding stay constant (they will not). Omit by default for short windows (e.g. 1-day pulls).

---

## 4) Generic gold (scale / discover)

Terms classified as **generic** (not matching brand markers; not ASIN-format). **Intent:** harvest to exact, test bids, expand coverage.

- Definition used (ACoS ceiling, min clicks, min sales)
- Table: top N — sort key stated
- Columns: search term, spend, sales, ACoS, orders, CVR, CPC, clicks, **confidence** (e.g. comfortable vs bare-min vs degraded-mode)
- If **degraded** sufficiency: frame as **candidates to monitor** over a longer window, not “scale immediately.”

---

## 5) Branded gold (defend)

Terms classified as **branded** (brand markers or clear brand navigational intent per user). **Intent:** **defend** bids, monitor conquest, protect budget — **not** the same as generic scale.

- Same columns as §4 where applicable; separate table
- Short line: branded queries often look “gold” by efficiency — that is **expected**, not necessarily incremental demand

---

## 6) Rising stars

Split **generic** vs **branded** (or two sub-tables):

- **Generic rising stars** — scale / test framing
- **Branded rising stars** (e.g. misspellings) — **defensive** framing (capture variant queries, don’t treat as new demand)

Definition used (spend cap, min clicks, sales > 0)

---

## 7) Product targeting / ASIN-format stream (optional but recommended)

When ASIN-shaped strings appear in the search term column:

- **Volume:** row count, spend, clicks, sales (if mapped) **only for ASIN-format terms**
- **Default:** excluded from §3–6 keyword lists — explain: negatives are **negative product targets**, not keyword negatives; PAT behavior differs from query mining
- If user opts in: rank ASIN “terms” by spend or efficiency with a **PAT / conquest** narrative, not keyword-negative recommendations

---

## 8) Recommendations

- Order: **plug leaks** (negatives / targets) → **generic scale** → **brand defense** → **PAT** if applicable
- Each bullet ties to a term or count and to **keyword vs product target** action type

---

## 9) Caveats and sufficiency

- Median clicks, window length, and why strict negatives were allowed or refused
- If **interest-only** (no cost): state no ACoS/CPC/negative spend analysis; only CTR/CVR-style signals
- Re-run: recommend **14–30 days** for portfolio mining when window was short or median clicks were low
