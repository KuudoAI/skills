# Product Attributes & Submission Error Codes

Load this when a listing is missing structured data, when a submission or flat-file
upload fails with a numeric error code, or when the user asks why their product
isn't showing up in filters/refinements.

## Why attributes matter

Product attributes are the specific facts unique to a product — shoes have color and
size, lamps have wattage and bulb type. Some combine values (unit count is a number
*plus* a unit count type: "12 count", "6 pack").

They earn their keep in three distinct ways, and it's worth naming all three when
recommending attribute work, because sellers usually only think of the first:

1. **Search visibility.** Attributes index the product so it appears in relevant
   searches, and they power the **refinement filters** in the left panel. A missing
   attribute doesn't just lose a keyword — it removes the product from every filtered
   browse path that uses it.
2. **Product evaluation.** On the detail page, complete attributes let a shopper
   confirm the product fits their need without leaving the page.
3. **Rufus (Amazon's AI shopping assistant).** Complete attributes give Rufus accurate
   context when it answers shopper questions about the product. Thin attributes mean
   the assistant has less to work with — and increasingly, that assistant sits between
   the shopper and the listing.

## The three attribute views

| View | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Required** | Must be completed for the listing to be created at all |
| **Recommended** | Attributes customers typically look for — Amazon curates this list against current customer trends |
| **All** | The complete available set for the product type |

**The practical target is: fill everything in the Recommended view.** Required-only is
the floor for existing, not the bar for performing. When auditing, report Recommended
gaps as real findings, not nice-to-haves.

Amazon updates these lists over time; the planned-changes document in Seller Central
tracks upcoming requirements.

## Getting the authoritative list for a product type

Do **not** rely on memory or on the category lists in `01-policy-rules.md` § 9 for
which attributes a specific product type requires. Those are a fallback.

Ground truth is the **Product Type Definitions API**: `getDefinitionsProductType`
for the listing's `productType`, live name `type_getDefinitionsProductType`. It
defines the current required, conditionally required, and optional attributes with
their valid values, and it stays in sync with Amazon's schema.

Those rules sit in a JSON schema behind `schema.link`, which the host must
fetch; the MCP sandbox can't. Only `propertyGroups` come back inline. If the
schema can't be fetched, validate a concrete patch with `VALIDATION_PREVIEW`
and read its `issues[]` (see `11-tool-access.md`).

The second source is the listing itself: `listings_getListingsItem` `attributes` shows
the exact attribute names in use for that SKU and marketplace, which is what a patch
path must match.

## Flat-file / template hygiene

**Use only Excel templates less than 90 days old.** Older templates fall out of parity
with current requirements and produce confusing validation failures. The template
version is in **cell B1** of every template.

**For drop-down attributes, never paste a value that isn't in the drop-down list.**
Copy-pasted near-miss values are the most common cause of error 90057. Select from the
list.

## Submission error codes

| Code | Name | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **90057** | Invalid value | An attribute contains a value not in its valid-value list | Replace with a value from the attribute's drop-down and resubmit |
| **90220** | Missing required attribute | A required attribute is absent | Provide the value. If using an older template, download the latest first |
| **90225** | Character limit exceeded | An attribute value exceeds its maximum character count | Shorten below the threshold (check the field's limit — title 75, bullet 255, item highlights 125, description 2000) |
| **90248** | Conditional field error | A field was provided when the preconditions prohibit it | Review the attribute's preconditions and remove fields not allowed under the current circumstances |
| **97779** | Generic keywords length exceeded | `generic_keyword` exceeds the byte limit | Reduce to **under 200 bytes** (see `01-policy-rules.md` § 5 for the 200-vs-250 discrepancy) |
| **99001** | Missing required value | A required attribute or column value is missing | Fill every red-highlighted cell in the template and resubmit |
| **99010** | Missing conditional group value | Values from a conditionally required group are missing or conflicting | Ensure all attributes in the group have valid values; check the **Data definition** and **Valid values** tabs of the category flat file before uploading; resubmit complete |

## The three most common errors — full resolution detail

These three account for most flat-file failures and have documented step-by-step
resolutions. The specifics (which tab, which colour, which cell) matter — they're
what turns "fix your template" into an actionable instruction.

### 90057 — invalid value

**Error message:** `The [attribute] field contains an invalid value: []. To correct this error, choose from the valid set of values.`

**Cause:** a value was submitted into a field that only accepts values from a
predetermined list.

**Resolution:**
1. Download the uploaded template and check the affected attributes in the
   **"Feed Processing Summary"** tab.
2. Affected attributes are highlighted in **orange** in the template.
3. Replace each invalid value by selecting from that attribute's **drop-down list**.
4. Resubmit.

**The multi-product-type trap:** when uploading several products that differ in
nature, select **all** the relevant product types *before* downloading the template.
Attributes — and therefore valid values — are unique per product type, so a template
downloaded for one PT is missing the valid values the others need. This is a common
cause of "I picked from the drop-down and it still failed."

**Never copy-paste into a drop-down field.** Pasted values bypass the list and are
validated server-side, where they fail.

### 99001 — missing required value

**Error message:** `A value is required for this column: {0}`

**Cause:** a required attribute or column was left empty.

**Resolution:**
1. Fill **`product_type` in column A** first — doing so highlights every required
   attribute in **red** cells. Cross-check all red cells before submitting.
2. Consult the **"Required?"** column in the template's **"Data Definitions"** tab —
   it marks each field as *required*, *preferred*, or *optional*. (This is also the
   cleanest way to answer "is this attribute actually mandatory?")
3. If the attribute named in the error isn't present in the template at all,
   **download the latest template** for that product type and refill.

**Prevention:** templates under 90 days old (version in **cell B1**), and never paste
over drop-down cells such as `product_type` — those are back-end validated.

### 99010 — missing conditional group value

**Error message:** `A value is missing from one or more required columns from this group: [Sale Price = null], [Sale Start Date = "2021-05-26"], [Sale End Date = "2022-05-26"].`

**Cause:** one column in a conditionally required *group* was filled while its
siblings were left empty or conflicting. The group is all-or-nothing.

**Known conditional groups** — illustrative, **not exhaustive**. Groups vary by
category, which is why step 2 below matters more than this table:

| If this is filled | These become required |
|---|---|
| Sale Price | Sale Start Date **and** Sale End Date |
| Product ID | Product ID Type |
| Parentage | Variation Theme |

**Additional constraints on the sale-price group:**
- Dates must be formatted `YYYY-MM-DD` or `DD-MM-YYYY`. A valid date in the wrong
  format still errors.
- Sale start date must be **earlier than** sale end date.

**Resolution:**
1. Populate **every** attribute in the group with valid values — the group is
   all-or-nothing, so a partially filled group fails exactly like an empty one.
2. Verify the group membership in the **"Data Definitions"** and **"Valid Values"**
   tabs of the category-specific flat file *before* uploading. **Name these two tabs
   explicitly when advising a user** — they are where conditional groups for *that*
   category are actually defined, and they're the only reliable way to find a group
   that isn't in the table above. Don't send someone to a generic "template tab";
   these two tabs are the answer.
3. Re-check date formats and ordering if the sale-price group is involved.
4. Resubmit.

Note that the error report tallies errors per group — a single missing column can
produce hundreds of counted errors across rows. A large error count usually means one
systematic omission, not hundreds of distinct problems. Say so before a user starts
fixing rows one at a time.

### How to handle an error code in conversation

1. **Name the code and what it means** — sellers see the number, not the explanation.
2. **Point at the specific attribute**, not the general class. Pull the listing's
   `issues[]` and the attribute in question rather than reciting the generic cause.
3. **90225 is a length error — check which field.** With the 75-char title limit, this
   now fires on titles that were compliant under the old 200-char cap. Trimming the
   title and relocating the surplus to item highlights is usually the right fix
   (`01-policy-rules.md` § 2).
4. **90057 / 99010 need the valid-value list**, which comes from the Definitions API or
   the flat file's Valid values tab — not from guessing a plausible value.
5. These are **submission-time** errors. Fixing them is a normal patch, and it still
   goes through preview → confirm → submit.
