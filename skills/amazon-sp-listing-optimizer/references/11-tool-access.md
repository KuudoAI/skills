# Tool access

Load this before the first call of a session. Tool names and behaviour
below were verified live, read-only, on 2026-09-24. For audits and scans,
also load `12-read-patterns.md`. The server's own tool descriptions and
schemas are the authority. If they disagree with this file, follow them.

## Surface

On a code-mode SP-API MCP server, the client sees three tools:

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `search(query, limit?)` | Find tools by keyword. Search the operationId, such as `getListingsItem`. A `tags` filter can return nothing, so don't rely on it |
| `get_schema(tools=[…], detail?)` | Argument schema. Use `detail="full"` before the first patch of a session, because `patches` is nested |
| `execute(code)` | Async Python: `await call_tool(name, params)`; only the final `return` comes back |

Other hosts expose the same operations as direct tools. Use their names and
schemas; everything else in this file still applies.

## Tool names

| Operation | Tool | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `getListingsItem` | `listings_getListingsItem` | One SKU's submitted state: `summaries`, `attributes`, `issues`, `offers`, `fulfillmentAvailability`, `relationships` |
| `searchListingsItems` | `listings_searchListingsItems` | Many SKUs: counts, filters, and paged scans. Also confirms which SKU owns an ASIN |
| `patchListingsItem` | `listings_patchListingsItem` | The only listing write this skill makes. Top-level `mode: "VALIDATION_PREVIEW"`; requires `sellerId`, `sku`, `marketplaceIds`, `productType`, `patches` |
| `getCatalogItem` | `catalog_getCatalogItem` | Amazon's catalog view: classification, browse node, family, images, rank |
| `getDefinitionsProductType` | `type_getDefinitionsProductType` | Attribute groups inline. The required and conditional rules and valid values sit in a JSON schema behind `schema.link`, which the host must fetch. Otherwise use a `VALIDATION_PREVIEW`'s `issues[]` as the practical validator |
| `getInventorySummaries` | `fba-inventory_getInventorySummaries` | FBA fulfillable quantity, which Listings doesn't report |
| `getListingsRestrictions` | `restriction_getListingsRestrictions` | Gating (used by `amazon-sp-listing-compliance`) |
| A+ Content | `aplus_searchContentDocuments`, `aplus_getContentDocument`, `aplus_createContentDocument`, `aplus_updateContentDocument`, `aplus_validateContentDocumentAsinRelations`, `aplus_postContentDocumentAsinRelations`, `aplus_listContentDocumentAsinRelations`, `aplus_postContentDocumentApprovalSubmission`, `aplus_postContentDocumentSuspendSubmission`, `aplus_searchContentPublishRecords` | A+ work. See `05-aplus-content.md` |

**Use these, not the legacy duplicates.** A server can also expose older API
versions under other prefixes (`listings-items-2020-09-01_*`,
`catalog-items-2020-12-01_*`, `catalog-items-v0_*`), and those have
different schemas. An unknown name fails with `Unknown tool: <name>`; there
is no fuzzy matching.

## Seller and marketplace

The seller-selection tools are callable from `execute`: `list_identities`,
`set_active_identity`, `get_active_region`, and `list_marketplaces`. There is
no `get_active_identity`. With nothing selected, calls fail with `Provider
identity selection is required.`

1. **Ask which seller** unless the user already said; never pick one
   yourself. `list_identities` takes no arguments and returns
   `{"result": [{id, label, attributes: {account_id, declared_region}}]}`.
   An account can see 150 or more identities, so filter to the user's
   merchant ID inside the sandbox and return only the match. If one merchant
   ID maps to several identities (one per region), ask which marketplace.
2. The identity's `label` is the merchant ID, which is the Listings API's
   `sellerId`. Never substitute an account ID or a guess.
3. **The selection isn't private to your session.** Call
   `set_active_identity({"identity_id": …})` at the top of every `execute`
   block that touches seller data, and always in a write block.
4. Confirm the marketplace: US `ATVPDKIKX0DER`, UK `A1F83G8C2ARO7P`, DE
   `A1PA6795UKMFR9`, JP `A1VC38T7YXB528`. `get_active_region` follows the
   identity.

Don't pass `entityId` or tokens in operation params. Unknown keys are
accepted silently, so their presence proves nothing.

A 404 on `getListingsItem` for a SKU the user is sure exists usually means
the wrong identity is active, or the SKU belongs to another seller on the
ASIN. Check with `searchListingsItems` filtered by ASIN before concluding it
is missing.

## Sandbox limits

- **30 seconds** and at most **50 `call_tool()` calls** per `execute`
  block. Output over about **30 KB** is truncated.
- `import json` (and `re`, `math`) explicitly; they aren't preloaded.
  `time`, `collections`, and `itertools` aren't available, and
  `datetime.now()` fails, so write today's date as a literal. There's no
  `asyncio.sleep`, network, or file I/O.
- These fail: `%` formatting, dict union (`a | b`), and `next()` over a
  generator expression. Use f-strings, `d.update(...)`, and a list
  comprehension with `[0]`.
- Errors arrive as plain strings such as `Invalid params: Error calling tool
  'X': HTTP error 400: …`. Catch them and return Amazon's `errors[]`
  verbatim.

## Write blocks

Keep the preview and the live write in **separate** `execute` blocks, with
the user's typed confirmation between them. Never put a live write in the
same block as reads the user hasn't seen.

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": IDENTITY_ID})
r = await call_tool("listings_patchListingsItem", {
    "sellerId": MERCHANT_ID, "sku": SKU, "marketplaceIds": [MKT],
    "productType": PRODUCT_TYPE, "patches": PATCHES,
    "mode": "VALIDATION_PREVIEW",
})
return {"status": r.get("status"), "issues": r.get("issues", [])}
```

The live write is the same call without `mode`, in its own block. Hosts that
use `confirm=false` / `confirm=true` and an idempotency key instead of
`mode` follow the same preview, confirm, and submit rule.
