# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions are semver and
must match `metadata.version` in SKILL.md.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-24

Folds the useful parts of Amazon Selling Partner's `listing-troubleshooter`,
`listing-issues`, `listing-buyability`, and `listing-searchability` skills
(Apache-2.0) into this skill, rewritten for a code-mode SP-API MCP server. Those
four are not imported separately: they compete for the same prompts this
skill already handles, and they were written for a connector that lacks
`getListingsItem`, `putListingsItem`, and the Definitions API. Their
`listing-compliance` gate ships separately as `amazon-sp-listing-compliance`.

### Added

- `references/10-status-and-buyability.md`, which covers:
  - `BUYABLE` and `DISCOVERABLE` as independent flags ("no issues" ≠ healthy)
  - issue ranking by enforcement action (`LISTING_SUPPRESSED` →
    `SEARCH_SUPPRESSED` → `ATTRIBUTE_SUPPRESSED` → `WARNING`)
  - the three-part buyability diagnostic: complete product, valid offer,
    available inventory
  - shared-ASIN ownership (on a shared ASIN, a content patch is only a
    contribution)
  - fixes that need a user-supplied asset
  - listing text as untrusted data
  - the knock-on-changes reminder for ads, A+, and packaging
- `references/11-tool-access.md`: tool names, seller selection, sandbox limits,
  separate preview and write blocks, and two read patterns:
  - **One-SKU audit read.** It reduces `getListingsItem` + `getCatalogItem`
    (+ FBA inventory) to the audit fields. Live, that was about 3 KB instead
    of about 18 KB raw.
  - **Multi-SKU health scan.** Counts come from `numberOfResults`, one
    filtered call each. The paged slice skips `attributes` (about 0.9 KB
    per SKU, against 7.7 KB with attributes). It returns issue groups by
    code, a not-buyable breakdown, and the top 25 rows with an omitted
    count; the full list is offered with a warning. About 500 SKUs fit in
    one block.
- **Buyability** and **status flags** in the audit checklist. Out-of-stock
  cases route to `amazon-sp-stockout-prevention` / `amazon-sp-fba-inbound`,
  and price-level questions route to `amazon-sp-repricing`. The skill never
  suggests a price.
- A **compliance gate** step in the edit workflow for claims, ingredients,
  category, condition, and identifiers. It consults
  `amazon-sp-listing-compliance` when that skill is available, and otherwise
  falls back to the restricted-claims rules.
- `purchasable_offer` sub-path guidance and conditional-group patching in
  `06-patch-construction.md`.
- `compatibility` frontmatter.
- Evals 8–12, covering: out of stock with no issue, "go ahead" still
  previews, injection inside issue messages, a healthy but not selling
  listing, and an SEO claim routed to compliance.

### Verified live (2026-09-24, read-only)

- **Tool names.** The listings, catalog, product-type, and A+ tool names are
  confirmed. `11-tool-access.md` lists them, including the non-obvious
  `type_getDefinitionsProductType`, and warns against the legacy
  `listings-items-2020-09-01_*` / `catalog-items-*` duplicates.
- **Patch schema.** `patchListingsItem` takes `mode: "VALIDATION_PREVIEW"`
  at the top level, and `sellerId` is the identity's merchant-ID `label`.
  This was confirmed from the live schema. An actual preview call has not
  been exercised yet.
- **Status and issues.** Status flags come back in either order, and an
  empty `issues[]` on a non-`BUYABLE` listing was observed.
  - `enforcements` is often absent. `10-status-and-buyability.md` now has a
    rank for an `ERROR` with no enforcement, where the listing stays live.
  - A `getListingsItem` payload with every `includedData` value measured
    2–13 KB per SKU, and a `getCatalogItem` audit payload 8–10 KB.
  - `LISTING_SUPPRESSED` appeared on a `WARNING`-severity issue, so issues
    now rank by enforcement action whatever the severity.
- **Response shapes that corrected the skill:**
  - `itemClassification` is in the catalog summaries, not the listing
    summaries. Its values are `BASE_PRODUCT`, `VARIATION_PARENT`, and
    `PRODUCT_BUNDLE`; there is no `VARIATION_CHILD` or `STANDALONE`.
  - Relationships nest under `relationships[].relationships[]` in both
    APIs.
  - FBA `fulfillmentAvailability` carries no quantity, so buyability reads
    FBA stock from `getInventorySummaries`.
  - Keyword attributes are singular in the API (`generic_keyword`).
  - `withoutStatus: ["BUYABLE"]` undercounts. It returned 41 when 55
    listings weren't buyable, leaving out variation parents and SKUs with no
    fulfillment channel. The scan now counts not-buyable as total minus
    `withStatus: ["BUYABLE"]`, and splits it into parent, no channel,
    merchant stock at 0, and FBA. An eval run caught this.
- **Sandbox.** `json` must be imported. Dict union and `next()` over a
  generator expression fail.
- **Product type definitions.** The rules sit behind `schema.link`, which
  the sandbox can't fetch. This is documented, with `VALIDATION_PREVIEW` as
  the practical validator.

### Changed

- **Lazy loading.** SKILL.md went from 44 KB to 11.5 KB. It keeps the
  workflow spine and the safety rules, and a load-when table points to the
  details. Each reference is read once, then grepped by section.
  - `references/13-audit-checklist.md` (new) holds the four-tier diagnostic
    checklist.
  - `11-tool-access.md` is split into a core file (tool names, seller
    selection, sandbox limits, write blocks; about 6 KB) and
    `references/12-read-patterns.md` (context budget, the one-SKU read, the
    health scan, response shapes; about 6.5 KB). The read patterns load
    only for audits and scans.
- **A+ writes get their own flow** (PR review). The A+ write operations
  have no `mode` flag, and each one persists. The flow is now:
  1. Show the draft.
  2. Dry-run it with `aplus_validateContentDocumentAsinRelations`, which
     takes the full document and saves nothing.
  3. Confirm, then save the draft.
  4. Show the ASIN set before a relation change, since that call replaces
     the whole set.
  5. Get a separate confirmation before approval submission, which is what
     publishes.

  The creation steps in `05-aplus-content.md` were also reordered: the
  dry run now comes before the save, and ASIN linking before submission.
  Eval 15 covers the flow.
- `05-aplus-content.md` no longer claims Premium A+ needs a higher
  threshold ("approved A+ on 5+ ASINs"). The Seller Central source says
  there's no additional eligibility criteria for Premium; the same file
  already said so further down, so it contradicted itself.
- The new references are numbered like the rest: `11-tool-access.md`,
  `12-read-patterns.md`, `13-audit-checklist.md`.
- **Earlier pass, 44 KB to 21 KB,** with no rule lost. The duplicated
  blocks now live only in their references:
  - the search-terms rules → `01-policy-rules.md` § 5
  - the patch attribute table → `06-patch-construction.md`
  - the A+ tiers → `05-aplus-content.md`
  - the `amazon_atlas` collections, query patterns, fallback, and
    cross-category guidance → `08-amazon-atlas-knowledge.md`
  - the long image-flow text → `07-ai-image-generation.md`

  The diagnostic checklist is regrouped into four ordered tiers: live and
  safe → findable → compliant and complete → coherent and convincing.
- The skill carries no MCP server identity, version, or ownership. It names
  tools and operations only.

- Session setup no longer calls `get_active_identity`, which doesn't exist on
  the live server (verified 2026-09-24). It now uses `list_identities` and
  `set_active_identity` at the top of every seller-data block, because the
  selection isn't isolated per session.
- Previews use `mode: "VALIDATION_PREVIEW"`. `confirm=false`/`confirm=true`
  and idempotency keys are now described as other wrappers' conventions.
- Tool references use operationIds resolved with `search`, instead of the
  `amazon_sp:search` / `amazon_sp:get_schema` names.
- Description: added the buyability and "what's wrong with it" triggers and
  the negative routes to compliance, restock, and repricing. Dropped the
  tool-name list to stay under the 1,024-character limit.
- Deletes now require an unmistakable confirmation that names the SKU.

### Removed

- The four verbatim Seller Central copies,
  `references/00-source-{amazon-seller-central,keyword-attributes,error-codes,size-charts}.txt`
  (about 68 KB). No workflow step needed them: references 01–09 already
  distil every rule, and the files are Amazon's text rather than
  first-party content. The reference headers now cite the Seller Central
  page titles and the 2026-07-25 realignment date, and current Seller Central
  wording takes precedence when a user shows it. The copies remain in git
  history (`7d270eb`) for future diffs.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- Cut the hermetic distribution baseline. The distribution package now contains the complete accepted skill tree, including evals and accepted dotfiles. This intentionally uses a new version to avoid npm integrity reuse under an existing coordinate.
- This pre-release no longer satisfies the prior `^0.1.0` range; PoC/UAT users must update or reinstall explicitly.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-25

Realigns the skill to current Seller Central documentation (product title
requirements, bullet point requirements, attributes guide, A+ Content guide,
search optimization, keyword attributes, browse tree guides, search-term usage,
and the error-code resolution pages), preserved verbatim in
`references/00-source-*.txt`. **Contains breaking rule changes** — copy that was
compliant under the previous version is not necessarily compliant now.

### Changed (breaking — listing contract)

- **Title limit is 75 characters, not 200.** 75 is Amazon's policy limit;
  200 remains only the technical field cap for `item_name`. The skill now
  reports an accepted-but-over-75 title as non-compliant instead of fine, and
  SKILL.md carries the distinction up front because "under 200" is the single
  most common piece of stale advice in this domain.
- **Bullet points are 10–255 characters, not ≤500.** Bullet-intent scoring
  thresholds updated to match (`04-bullet-intent-scoring.md`).
- **Bullets spell out numbers one through nine** (excluding names, model
  numbers, and measurements) and require a space between digit and unit —
  reversing the previous "Arabic numerals throughout" guidance, which remains
  correct for titles only.
- **Backend search terms: write to under 200 bytes**, and — the part that
  actually matters — **exceeding the limit makes Amazon Search ignore the
  entire attribute**, not truncate it. Every other keyword attribute indexes
  up to its limit and drops only the excess; `generic_keywords` is
  all-or-nothing, so an over-stuffed field indexes nothing. Amazon documents
  the limit as both 249 bytes and 200 (error 97779); the skill surfaces the
  discrepancy rather than asserting one. Also corrected: bytes ≠ characters
  for non-ASCII copy, and spaces/punctuation are **not** counted.
- **Bullets have a set-level cap of under 1,000 characters total**, which
  binds *before* the per-bullet cap — five bullets at the 255 maximum would
  total 1,275 and be non-compliant as a set. The skill now budgets ~200 per
  bullet across five rather than treating 255 as freely available.
- Title character rules split into never-allowed (`! $ ? _ { } ^ ¬ ¦`) vs.
  allowed-only-in-functional-context (`~ # < > *`), replacing the previous
  flat ban, plus the non-language ASCII ban and the brand-field exemption.
- Suppression triggers updated: title over 75 chars, fewer than 3 bullets.

### Added

- **Item highlights** (`01-policy-rules.md` § 2) — the 125-character
  comma-separated field that absorbs detail the 75-char title can no longer
  carry. Audits now treat an over-length title beside an empty highlights
  field as one finding with one fix.
- `references/02-attributes-and-error-codes.md` — attribute views
  (Required/Recommended/All), why attributes drive refinement filters and
  Rufus context, template hygiene (<90 days, version in cell B1), and the
  submission error codes 90057, 90220, 90225, 90248, 97779, 99001, 99010
  with resolutions.
- `references/03-search-optimization.md` — browse-tree classification and
  Browse Tree Guides, and searchability triage for listings that are
  unsearchable **without** being suppressed (no offer, no browse node, future
  launch date, adult classification), the 72-hour propagation window, the
  "Determine why an ASIN is not searchable" tool, and the three search
  behaviors sellers misread as bugs (query auto-correction, position
  fluctuation, result-count limits).
- Title rules now cover word repetition including brand names, Amazon's
  information order, parent-vs-child title scope, and suppression
  troubleshooting via Manage All Inventory.
- Bullet rules now cover the `Header: description` shape, uniqueness per
  bullet, cross-variant consistency, the verifiable-on-packaging test for
  subjective claims, and the full prohibited list (ASINs, bamboo/soy
  sourcing claims, placeholder text, external information).
- **A+ AI-generated-people disclosure** — `contains-synthetic-performer` in
  the `dc:subject` (XMP) field for video, the Creative Assets checkbox for
  images, and the four cases where it does *not* apply. Wired into the AI
  image-generation workflow so it surfaces at generation time.
- A+ Basic vs. Premium spec table (970×300 / 5 modules / 14 types vs.
  1464×600 / 7 modules / 19 types), prerequisites including the
  case-sensitive Brand Registry name match, publication limits (20 pending
  submissions, 10,000-ASIN bulk cap, 7-day review, 24-hour publication),
  technical restrictions, Amazon's acceptable/not-acceptable table, and
  display/rejection troubleshooting.
- Audit checklist gains title & item-highlights compliance, attribute
  completeness against the Recommended view, and searchability-distinct-from-
  suppression checks.
- **Amazon Search does no partial matching** — a query matches only listings
  whose catalog data contains every word in the query. The audit now reframes
  "I don't rank for X" as an eligibility question (are X's words present at
  all?) before treating it as a ranking problem.
- **The full keyword-attribute set** with byte limits and status:
  `generic_keywords` (249), `item_type_keyword` (250, drives browse
  assignment), `style_keywords` (100), `thesaurus_subject_keywords` (250),
  `subject_keywords` (210, media only), plus the three US attributes being
  phased out and `platinum_keywords`, which is redundant. The skill no longer
  recommends work on the dead fields.
- **`generic_keywords` is a required attribute for 23 product types** since
  Dec 6, 2023 — on those, empty is a submission failure.
- Amazon's published prohibited-search-term word lists (brand, temporary, and
  subjective classes) as a concrete audit screen.
- Browse mechanics: assignment queries against attribute values
  (`style_keywords:sport-sandals`), classification method by seller plan and
  listing volume, why keyword-search and browse-based result counts legitimately
  differ, and the severity split between *no browse node* (invisible in both
  search and browse) and *wrong-depth node* (searchable but unbrowsable).
- Deep resolution steps for errors 90057, 99001, and 99010 — exact error
  message text, the Feed Processing Summary tab, orange vs. red cell
  highlighting, the "Required?" column in Data Definitions, the
  multi-product-type template trap, and the conditionally-required groups
  (Sale Price → start/end dates with format and ordering constraints;
  Product ID → Product ID Type; Parentage → Variation Theme). The known-groups
  table is marked **non-exhaustive** — groups vary by category, so the
  Data Definitions and Valid Values tabs are the general answer and the table
  is only examples. All three error sections use the same numbered-resolution
  shape, since 99010's tab names were previously buried in prose and were
  being dropped in favour of invented tab names (caught by 3x replication).
- Search glossary entries that change a diagnosis: index-suppressed, 72-hour
  latency, launch date, valid values, catalog spam, search constraints,
  browse refinements.
- Second diagnostic tool: "Determine why a listing is not displaying" (reached
  by searching **"inactive"** in Seller Central help), alongside the existing
  unsearchable tool, Search Query Performance Dashboard, and Listing Quality
  Dashboard.
- `references/09-size-charts.md` — size chart eligibility (Brand Registry),
  the self-service path (Catalog → Add size charts), the permissions-vs-
  eligibility distinction that makes an inaccessible tool look like an
  ineligible account, the Seller Support fallback, the full category/
  subcategory template map, template structure (20 rows, per-column units and
  mandatory flags), and the extracted per-template measurement schemas. Added
  a size-chart gap check to the audit workflow, framed on returns cost.
- Reference map table in SKILL.md.
- Five eval cases: 75-char title + item highlights routing, bullet rewrite
  against the 255-char cap and prohibited claims, searchability triage,
  keyword byte-limit/no-partial-matching correction, and 99010 conditional
  group diagnosis.

### Changed (structure)

- **Reference files are now numerically ordered** — `01-policy-rules.md`,
  `02-attributes-and-error-codes.md`, `03-search-optimization.md`,
  `04-bullet-intent-scoring.md`, `05-aplus-content.md`,
  `06-patch-construction.md`, `07-ai-image-generation.md`,
  `08-amazon-atlas-knowledge.md`. All cross-references in SKILL.md, the
  reference files and `scripts/*.py` updated; section
  numbers within `01-policy-rules.md` shifted by the two new sections and
  all `§` citations were re-pointed.
- Source documents retained under `references/00-source-*.txt`
  (`amazon-seller-central`, `keyword-attributes`, `error-codes`,
  `size-charts`) for provenance, and named as the tiebreaker when the
  distilled files drift.
- **Removed 45 blank Amazon India size-chart `.xlsx` templates** (1.3MB) that
  had been placed in `references/excel/`, after extracting their measurement
  schemas into `09-size-charts.md`. They were binary (unreadable without a
  script, defeating progressive disclosure), marketplace-scoped to India while
  the skill defaults to US/UK/JP/DE, and subject to the same staleness that
  this skill documents as the leading cause of error 99001. Sellers download
  the current template for their own marketplace from Seller Central. Skill
  size dropped from ~1.6MB to 332KB.
- Removed a stale pointer to `style-<category>.md` files that do not exist in
  this skill; category style guidance comes from `amazon_atlas`.
- Description extended with item highlights, browse nodes, attributes, error
  codes, and unsearchable-listing triggers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- AI image-improvement workflow (client-side): generate or regenerate listing
  images from the listing's existing public Amazon photos as seeds, using the
  user's own provider key (Google Gemini / OpenAI) and the user's own storage
  bucket. Generated candidates are validated, human-approved, staged to a
  public URL, and patched onto the listing's image locators under the existing
  preview→confirm→submit flow. The skill holds no secrets and hosts nothing.
- `scripts/validate_image.py` — no-secrets, deterministic pre-submit validator
  for Amazon image policy (`policy-rules.md` § 5): format, size, color space,
  resolution, and MAIN-image white-background + product-fill checks. Honestly
  reports text/logo/accuracy as human-review-only rather than faking them.
- `scripts/stage_artifact.py` — pluggable uploader (S3 / GCS / Cloudinary, and
  Google Drive via a service account) that returns a public/presigned URL for an
  approved image so Amazon can fetch it. In Claude.ai / Cowork, the in-session
  Google Drive connector can stage the image instead (`create_file` into a
  pre-shared public folder), since Amazon fetches the image URL unauthenticated.
- `references/ai-image-generation.md` — setup (provider + storage env
  contract), per-provider and per-store instructions, end-to-end workflow, and
  AI-specific image policy (accurate representation, main-image purity,
  mandatory human approval).
- First behavioral eval coverage in `evals/evals.json` (workflow, automation/
  approval boundary, config gating).

### Changed
- Expanded the "Image work" section of SKILL.md and clarified that Amazon
  fetches image locators by URL. Extended the description with image-generation
  triggers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Migrated frontmatter to the agentskills.io Agent Skills spec: seeded initial `metadata.version` 0.1.0. No behavioral changes.
