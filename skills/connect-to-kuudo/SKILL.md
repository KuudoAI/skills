description: Use when an AI agent needs to connect to a human's Kuudo account before calling any Kuudo capability — checking whether the session already exposes the Agent Auth MCP tools, registering a delegated connection with them, presenting the human's approval link, and reading account/organization data once approved. Covers the connect/approve/execute flow, approval timeouts and expiry, and the one-installation-per-human rule. Do not use to configure an MCP server, edit client configuration, or install packages — point the human to Kuudo's own connection guide instead. Do not use to design or modify the Agent Auth protocol itself, to request capabilities beyond read_account and read_organization, or to approve, deny, or sign in on the human's behalf.
license: PolyForm-Shield-1.0.0 (see LICENSE.txt)
compatibility: Requires the human's client to already have an MCP connection to Kuudo's Agent Auth server, exposing tools such as connect_agent, execute_capability, and agent_status, and a way to show the human a link. This skill uses the session's actual exposed tool names and schemas; it does not configure MCP, edit client config, or install anything itself.

# Connect to Kuudo

## Overview

Kuudo authenticates AI agents through Agent Auth's delegated mode: an agent registers, a human approves the connection from their browser, and the agent then acts as that human inside the one organization they approved. Connecting the client to Kuudo's Agent Auth MCP server is a one-time, client-owned setup step outside this skill — see [Before you start](#before-you-start). This skill covers using that connection for the first time, presenting the approval link, and reading data once approved.

The agent never creates a Kuudo account, signs in, or approves its own request, and never sees the human's password or the contents of their verification email. A human without a Kuudo account yet creates one from the approval link.

## Before you start

Check the current session's exposed MCP tools for Kuudo's Agent Auth server. In `@auth/agent-cli@0.5.1`'s MCP mode these are named `connect_agent`, `execute_capability`, and `agent_status` — use whichever names and input schemas the session actually exposes, never an invented alias. This skill never configures an MCP server, edits `.cursor/mcp.json` or any other client configuration file, or installs a package — that setup belongs to the human and their client, not this skill.

If those tools aren't available in the session, stop here. Tell the human that connecting to Kuudo needs a one-time MCP connection first, and point them to Kuudo's "Connect your AI agent to Kuudo" guide at https://docs.kuudo.com. Do not attempt the setup yourself.

## Connect

Once the tools are available, request exactly two capabilities: `read_account` and `read_organization`. Never request more.

Call `connect_agent` once — its input schema requires `provider`; everything else is optional but should still be set deliberately:

```json
{
  "provider": "https://app.kuudo.com",
  "capabilities": ["read_account", "read_organization"],
  "mode": "delegated",
  "name": "Claude Code – acme/ads-reporting",
  "reason": "Read the organization ID for the ads-reporting pipeline",
  "login_hint": "you@example.com"
}
```

Pass `mode: "delegated"` explicitly — never `"autonomous"` — even though Kuudo only offers delegated mode: omitting `mode` makes the tool return a mode-selection prompt instead of connecting when it can't assume a single mode. `name` (the tool and the project) and `reason` (what the connection is for, in plain language) appear on the approval page and later at `/developers/agent-connections` — they're the human's only way to recognize this connection, so make them specific. Only set `login_hint` to the human's email if the human has actually given it in this conversation; never guess or invent one. Never pass `force_approval: true` — see [One connection per human](#one-connection-per-human).

## Present the approval link

Registering returns an approval URL (and, for device authorization, a short user code) valid for **15 minutes**. Show it to the human exactly as returned — verbatim, not paraphrased, not shortened. Tell them:

- If they don't have a Kuudo account yet, the link lets them create one and verify their email first; they land back on the same approval request afterward.
- The link is only good for 15 minutes.

Then wait. Never open, follow, fill in, or approve the link yourself, and never ask the human for their password or the contents of their verification email — connecting only ever needs their approval, not their credentials.

## If the wait times out

A single wait for approval can time out before the human has actually finished — signing up and verifying an email can take a few minutes. A timeout is not the same as expiry, and neither is the same as denial. Before doing anything else, call `agent_status` with the `agent_id` `connect_agent` returned:

```json
{ "agent_id": "<agent-id>" }
```

- Still pending and unexpired: keep waiting (check status again, or let the human know the link is still live) — do not reconnect.
- `approval_expired`, or the human explicitly denied it (`agent_rejected`): only now reconnect — call `connect_agent` again. Reconnecting registers a new agent with a new link; the old link stops working. Only do this if the human still wants to connect; a denial is a "no," not a glitch to retry past.
- `agent_revoked`: this was an approved, active connection that later got revoked — a different situation from the wait timing out. Reconnect only if the agent still needs access.

## One connection per human

One local Agent Auth installation belongs to one human — whoever approves its first connection becomes its permanent owner. A different human approving a later connection from the same installation is refused with `capability_request_owner_mismatch`. Never pass `connect_agent`'s `force_approval: true` to move an installation to a different person — it exists specifically to reset the existing binding so a different user can authenticate, which is exactly the switch this rule forbids. If a second human needs to connect, they need their own installation, not this one.

## After connecting: read account and organization

Once approved, call `execute_capability` with the `agent_id` `connect_agent` returned:

```json
{ "agent_id": "<agent-id>", "capability": "read_account" }
```

```json
{
  "agent_id": "<agent-id>",
  "capability": "read_organization",
  "arguments": { "organization_id": "<organization-id-from-read_account>" }
}
```

`read_account` returns the human's account ID, name, email, and the ID of the organization they approved. `read_organization` needs that exact `organization_id` in `arguments` and returns the organization's name and slug.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `approval_timeout` | This client's own wait gave up before the 15-minute link expired. | Check status; the approval may still complete. Don't reconnect yet. |
| `approval_expired` | The 15-minute link actually ran out. | Reconnect — a new agent and link. |
| `agent_rejected` | The human explicitly denied the approval request. | Reconnect only if the human still wants to connect; don't treat a "no" as a retry-able glitch. |
| `agent_revoked` | An approved, active connection was later revoked. | Reconnect from the agent if it still needs access. |
| `capability_request_owner_mismatch` | A different human than this installation's owner tried to approve it. | Use a separate installation per human; never force it. |
| `agent_access_denied` | The connection lost access (membership or binding changed) after being active. | Reconnect from the agent. |
| `organization_not_found` | The `organization_id` passed to `read_organization` doesn't match the approved one. | Use the `organization_id` `read_account` returned; don't guess one. |
| `agent_access_unavailable` | Kuudo couldn't serve the request right now. | Retry. |

## Common mistakes

- Requesting capabilities beyond `read_account` and `read_organization`.
- Paraphrasing, shortening, or partially retyping the approval link or code.
- Reconnecting on a plain `approval_timeout` without checking status first.
- Treating `agent_rejected` (the human said no) the same as `approval_timeout` or `approval_expired` (nobody has answered yet) and reconnecting anyway.
- Approving, denying, or signing in on the human's behalf, or asking for their password or verification email.
- Running MCP setup commands, editing client configuration, or installing a package to work around missing Agent Auth tools instead of pointing the human to Kuudo's own connection guide.
- Passing `force_approval: true` to move a connection to a different human instead of using a separate installation.
