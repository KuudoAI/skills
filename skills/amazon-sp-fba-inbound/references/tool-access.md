# Tool access on a code-mode SP-API MCP server

These notes were verified live, read-only, on 2026-09-24. The server's own tool
descriptions and `get_schema` output are the authority. If they disagree
with this file, follow them.

## Surface

The client sees three tools:

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `search(query, limit?, detail?)` | Find tools by keyword. Search the operationId, or `fba inbound`. Don't rely on the `tags` filter: inbound tools aren't tagged `fba-inbound`, and a tag search returns nothing |
| `get_schema(tools=[…], detail?)` | Argument schema. `detail="detailed"` lists only top-level parameters. Use **`detail="full"`** for writes with nested bodies, such as `setPackingInformation`, `generateTransportationOptions`, `confirmTransportationOptions`, and `updateShipmentTrackingDetails` |
| `execute(code)` | Async Python; `await call_tool(name, params)`; the final `return` is the result |

Tool names are `<package-prefix>_<operationId>`:

- `fba-inbound_…` covers the 45 v2024-03-20 operations.
- `fulfillment-inbound-v0_…` covers `getLabels`, `getBillOfLading`, and the
  other supported v0 reads.
- Unknown names fail with `Unknown tool: <name>`. There is no fuzzy matching.

Request body fields are flattened into top-level arguments next to the path
parameters. For example, `createInboundPlan` takes
`{destinationMarketplaces, items, sourceAddress, name}`.

The server-context tools are callable only from `execute`:

- `list_identities`
- `set_active_identity`
- `set_active_region`
- `get_active_region`
- `list_marketplaces`
- `clear_selection`

There is no session-state, active-identity, or envelope-contract tool on
this server.

**Return shapes differ by tool type:**

- Server-context tools wrap their output. `list_identities` returns
  `{"result": [...]}` and `get_active_region` returns `{"result": "na"}`.
  Unwrap with `r.get("result", r)`.
- SP-API tools return Amazon's payload directly, for example
  `{"inboundPlans": [...], "pagination": {...}}`.

## Packages

The operator chooses which packages load (`all` on the reference
deployment). If `search` for an inbound operationId and `search("fba
inbound")` both return no `fba-inbound_*` tools, the package isn't loaded.
Tell the user to enable `fulfillment-inbound` (and `fulfillment-inbound-v0`)
in the server's package setting, then restart it.

## Identity and region: required before any SP-API call

With no identity selected, SP-API calls fail with
`Provider identity selection is required.`

> **Server caveat, observed 2026-09-24.** The selected identity is **not
> isolated per MCP session.** A selection made in one session was visible to
> other sessions using the same token. A session that never selected anyone
> received another seller's data.
>
> So **call `set_active_identity` at the top of every `execute` block that
> touches seller data**, including every write block. Never rely on a
> selection carried over from an earlier call. This narrows the window for
> the wrong seller but doesn't close it. Report it to the server operator if
> you see data that doesn't match the requested seller.

1. `list_identities` takes no arguments. It returns `{"result": [{id, label,
   attributes: {account_id, declared_region}}]}`. `label` is the seller's
   merchant ID. `declared_region` is a country code such as `US`, not the
   SP region; `get_active_region` gives that.
   - Agency tokens return 150 or more entries. **Filter inside the sandbox**
     and return only the match. The full list wastes context and exposes
     other clients' IDs.

     ```python
     ids = (await call_tool("list_identities", {})).get("result", [])
     hits = [i for i in ids if i["label"] == "A2GQWJZXTY0M66"]
     return [{"id": i["id"], "region": i["attributes"].get("declared_region")} for i in hits]
     ```
   - One merchant ID can appear once per region (for example US and CA). If
     it maps to several identities, ask which marketplace.
   - When asking the user to choose a seller, give counts by region and ask
     for the merchant ID or store name. Don't paste the list.
   - Ask which seller unless the user already said. Never pick one
     yourself.
   - For a status question that spans accounts, confirm the scope first.
2. `set_active_identity({"identity_id": "<id>"})`. Repeat it at the top of
   each seller-data `execute` block (see the caveat above).
3. `get_active_region` confirms the region: `na`, `eu`, or `fe`. It follows
   the identity.
   - Change it with `set_active_region` only for a marketplace outside the
     identity's region.
   - `list_marketplaces` maps each marketplace ID to its region. India
     (`A21TJRUUN4KGV`) is `eu`.
4. A **403 `Unauthorized`** on an inbound call is an account-authorization
   problem, not a request problem. The live message was "Authorization
   between the party and the application is not active". That means the
   seller's authorization of the app is inactive (expired or revoked) or
   lacks the Amazon Fulfillment role. Don't retry. Tell the seller to
   re-authorize the app in Seller Central (Manage Your Apps) with the
   Amazon Fulfillment role, or to reconnect the account through the
   provider that manages their connection, then ask again.

Don't pass `entityId`, a merchant ID, or tokens in operation params. They
aren't in the schema, and the server may accept and silently ignore them, so
their presence proves nothing. The active identity decides the seller.

## Efficient `execute` patterns

Each `execute` is a full model round trip. Some responses are large: one
real `listShipmentBoxes` call returned 780 boxes. **Summarize inside the
sandbox** (counts, totals, the first few rows) and return only that.

Sandbox limits:

- **A 30-second time limit per `execute`** (measured live). At about 0.5
  to 1 second per call, run 20 or fewer `getInboundPlan` or `getShipment`
  calls per block. Fast listing calls can go up to about 40.
- **At most 50 `call_tool()` calls per `execute`.** Call 51 fails with
  `Tool call limit exceeded`. Plan fan-outs in chunks (see the time limit above), and
  carry a cursor between blocks.
- Output over about 30 KB is truncated, so return summaries.
- No `asyncio.sleep`, no network, no file I/O. No `dir`, `hasattr`, or
  `print` output.
- The stdlib is restricted. `json`, `re`, and `math` work. `time`,
  `collections`, and `itertools` don't.
- `datetime` imports, but `datetime.now()` fails ("OS function not
  implemented"). Get today's date on the host and write it into the code
  as a literal.
- `%` string formatting fails. Use f-strings.

**Write, check, read, and summarize in one block:**

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": SELLER_ID})  # every block
P = "fba-inbound_"
plan = "wf…"
op = await call_tool(P + "generatePlacementOptions", {"inboundPlanId": plan})
st = await call_tool(P + "getInboundOperationStatus", {"operationId": op["operationId"]})
if st["operationStatus"] != "SUCCESS":
    return {"status": st["operationStatus"], "operationId": op["operationId"],
            "problems": st.get("operationProblems", [])}
opts = await call_tool(P + "listPlacementOptions", {"inboundPlanId": plan})
def net(o):
    fee = sum(i["value"]["amount"] for i in o.get("fees", []))
    disc = sum(i["value"]["amount"] for i in o.get("discounts", []))
    cur = (o.get("fees") or o.get("discounts") or [{"value": {"code": "?"}}])[0]["value"]["code"]
    return {"fee": fee, "discount": disc, "net": round(fee - disc, 2), "currency": cur}
return [{"placementOptionId": o["placementOptionId"], "status": o["status"],
         "expiration": o.get("expiration"), "shipments": o["shipmentIds"], **net(o)}
        for o in opts["placementOptions"]]
```

**Fan out reads in one block.** For example, run `getShipment` for every
shipment, then return only destination `warehouseId`, status,
`shipmentConfirmationId`, and `selectedTransportationOptionId`.

`trackingDetails` comes back even when nothing has been entered, as
`{"ltlTrackingDetail": {}, "spdTrackingDetail": {"spdTrackingItems": []}}`.
Test the contents:

```python
t = s.get("trackingDetails") or {}
has_tracking = bool((t.get("spdTrackingDetail") or {}).get("spdTrackingItems")) \
    or bool((t.get("ltlTrackingDetail") or {}).get("freightBillNumber"))
```

**Page inside the block:**

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": SELLER_ID})
out, token = [], None
while True:
    args = {"inboundPlanId": plan, "placementOptionId": pl, "pageSize": 20}
    if token:
        args["paginationToken"] = token
    r = await call_tool(P + "listTransportationOptions", args)
    out += r["transportationOptions"]
    token = (r.get("pagination") or {}).get("nextToken")
    if not token:
        break
return [{"shipmentId": t["shipmentId"], "id": t["transportationOptionId"],
         "carrier": t["carrier"].get("name"), "mode": t["shippingMode"],
         "solution": t["shippingSolution"], "cost": (t.get("quote") or {}).get("cost"),
         "preconditions": t["preconditions"]} for t in out]
```

**Never put a hard-gated confirm in the same block as reads the seller
hasn't seen.** The confirm goes in its own block, after the typed `CONFIRM`.

**Polling.** There is no sleep, so don't spin on `getInboundOperationStatus`
in a loop. If the status is `IN_PROGRESS`, return it and check again in a
later `execute`.

## Filter-first read patterns

Both patterns return counts for everything and rows for the slice. Measured
live on 2026-09-24 against a seller with 187 ACTIVE plans and a 780-box
shipment.

### Plan overview (filter by plan status first)

A plan's list-level `status` already tells you a lot. **SHIPPED** means its
shipments have left, so count those plans without opening them. Open only
recent **ACTIVE** plans; they're the ones that need sorting into draft,
awaiting a decision, or ready to ship.

One live seller had 205 plans updated in 60 days, 175 of them SHIPPED.
Opening everything took 11 blocks and about 205 calls. Opening only ACTIVE
plans takes 1 or 2.

Each `execute` also has a 30-second time limit, and `getInboundPlan` takes
about 0.5 to 1 second, so open 20 or fewer per block.

**Phase 1: list and count.** A few calls; returns counts plus recent ACTIVE
IDs only.

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": SID})
P = "fba-inbound_"
CUTOFF = "2026-07-26"          # 60 days back, computed on the host
out = {"shipped_recent": 0, "active_recent_ids": [], "listed_at_least": {}}
for status in ("SHIPPED", "ACTIVE"):
    tok = None
    while True:
        a = {"status": status, "sortBy": "LAST_UPDATED_TIME", "sortOrder": "DESC", "pageSize": 30}
        if tok:
            a["paginationToken"] = tok
        r = await call_tool(P + "listInboundPlans", a)
        page = r.get("inboundPlans", [])
        out["listed_at_least"][status] = out["listed_at_least"].get(status, 0) + len(page)
        fresh = [p["inboundPlanId"] for p in page if p.get("lastUpdatedAt", "") >= CUTOFF]
        if status == "SHIPPED":
            out["shipped_recent"] += len(fresh)
        else:
            out["active_recent_ids"] += fresh
        tok = (r.get("pagination") or {}).get("nextToken")
        if not tok or len(fresh) < len(page):
            break          # sorted by update time, so older pages are all stale
return out
```

**Phase 2: sort recent ACTIVE plans into buckets,** 20 or fewer IDs per
block. Accumulate the totals on the host.

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": SID})
P = "fba-inbound_"
IDS = ["wf…", "wf…"]           # 20 or fewer per block
buckets = {"ready_to_ship": 0, "awaiting_decision": 0, "draft": 0, "other": 0, "awd": 0}
ready = []
for pid in IDS:
    try:
        g = await call_tool(P + "getInboundPlan", {"inboundPlanId": pid})
    except Exception as e:
        buckets["awd" if "Warehousing and Distribution" in str(e) else "other"] += 1
        continue
    sh = g.get("shipments", [])
    rts = [x["shipmentId"] for x in sh if x["status"] == "READY_TO_SHIP"]
    if rts:
        buckets["ready_to_ship"] += 1
        ready += [{"plan": pid, "shipment": x} for x in rts]
    elif any(o.get("status") == "OFFERED" for o in g.get("placementOptions", [])):
        buckets["awaiting_decision"] += 1   # confirm expiry with listPlacementOptions
    elif not sh:
        buckets["draft"] += 1
    else:
        buckets["other"] += 1
return {"buckets": buckets, "ready_to_ship": ready[:25], "ready_total": len(ready)}
```

**Phase 3, only when the question needs it:** open SHIPPED plans for
shipment-level status, such as "what arrives this week" or "is SKU X on the
way". Filter first: the 20 most recent, or only the plans whose
`listInboundPlanItems` contain the SKU. Don't open all of them to answer
"what's in progress"; the SHIPPED count already answers that.

Report the phase 1 counts ("175 plans shipped since Jul 26"), the phase 2
buckets, and at most 25 rows. Say how many matched, and give the cutoff.

### Shipment contents summary

Return units per SKU and a box summary, never raw box records.

```python
await call_tool("set_active_identity", {"identity_id": SID})
P = "fba-inbound_"
PLAN = "wf…"
SH = "sh…"
units, tok = {}, None
while True:
    a = {"inboundPlanId": PLAN, "shipmentId": SH, "pageSize": 1000}
    if tok:
        a["paginationToken"] = tok
    r = await call_tool(P + "listShipmentItems", a)
    for i in r.get("items", []):
        units[i["msku"]] = units.get(i["msku"], 0) + i.get("quantity", 0)
    tok = (r.get("pagination") or {}).get("nextToken")
    if not tok:
        break
n_boxes, weight, dims, tok = 0, 0.0, {}, None
while True:
    a = {"inboundPlanId": PLAN, "shipmentId": SH, "pageSize": 1000}
    if tok:
        a["paginationToken"] = tok
    r = await call_tool(P + "listShipmentBoxes", a)
    for b in r.get("boxes", []):
        q = b.get("quantity", 1) or 1
        n_boxes += q
        w = b.get("weight") or {}
        weight += (w.get("value") or 0) * q
        d = b.get("dimensions") or {}
        k = f"{d.get('length')}x{d.get('width')}x{d.get('height')} {d.get('unitOfMeasurement', '')}"
        dims[k] = dims.get(k, 0) + q
    tok = (r.get("pagination") or {}).get("nextToken")
    if not tok:
        break
top = sorted(units.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])
return {"skus": len(units), "units": sum(units.values()),
        "top_skus": [{"msku": m, "units": u} for m, u in top[:25]],
        "boxes": n_boxes, "total_weight": round(weight, 1),
        "box_sizes": dict(sorted(dims.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:5])}
```

## Errors

Inside `execute`, a failed call raises a plain `Exception`. Its message is a
string, not JSON. Catch it with `except Exception as e` and read `str(e)`:

| Message pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Unknown tool: <name>` | Wrong name, or package not loaded | `search`; check packages |
| `Provider identity selection is required.` | No identity selected | `list_identities`, ask which seller, `set_active_identity` |
| `<provider> service is unavailable.` for one seller while others work | The connection provider can't mint an Amazon token for that seller (upstream 500 on its token exchange) | Report a broken connection for that seller, not an outage. Retry at most once; the connection needs re-authorization with its provider |
| `…HTTP error 403: … 'code': 'Unauthorized'…` | The seller's app authorization is inactive or lacks the Amazon Fulfillment role | Don't retry. Tell the seller to re-authorize (Seller Central, Manage Your Apps) or reconnect through the provider |
| `…HTTP error 400: … {'errors': [{'code', 'message', 'details'}]}` | Amazon rejected the request | Read `message`; fix the input |
| `…HTTP error 400: … not supported for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution inbound plans` | An AWD plan appeared in `listInboundPlans` | Label it AWD and skip; this skill doesn't manage AWD |
| `…HTTP error 429…` or `5xx` | Throttled or transient; the server doesn't retry | Pause, then retry once or twice |

An uncaught error aborts the whole `execute` block. Outside the sandbox it
surfaces as JSON-RPC error `-32603`. Wrap each call in its own `try/except`
when you fan out, so one bad plan doesn't sink the batch.

## Labels and documents

`createMarketplaceItemLabels`, v0 `getLabels`, v0 `getBillOfLading`, and
`getDeliveryChallanDocument` return a pre-signed HTTPS link to the PDF:

- `documentDownloads[].uri` for item labels
- `DownloadURL` for v0 labels and bills of lading

Give the seller the link right away. The links expire; item labels carry an
`expiration`. If a link has expired, call the operation again for a fresh
one.
