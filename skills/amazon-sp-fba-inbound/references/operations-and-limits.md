# Operations, statuses, limits, and errors

## All v2024-03-20 operations (45)

- **Async** means the operation returns an `operationId`; poll
  `getInboundOperationStatus`.

Also useful: `getItemEligibilityPreview` from the FBA Inbound Eligibility
API. It checks whether an ASIN can be inbounded to a marketplace. On the
KuudoAI server the tool is
`fba-inbound-eligibility_getItemEligibilityPreview`.

The v0 operations that remain supported are `getLabels`, `getBillOfLading`,
`getShipments`, `getShipmentItems`, `getShipmentItemsByShipmentId`, and
`getPrepInstructions`, all at about 2/30. The other v0 inbound operations were
removed on 2025-01-21. On the KuudoAI server their tool names are
`fulfillment-inbound-v0_<operationId>`.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| Plan size | At most 1,500 SKUs and 10,000 units per SKU per plan (Amazon FAQ; the schema is looser) |
| Destination | One marketplace per plan |
| Expiration dates | One MSKU with different expiration dates can't share a plan; use separate plans |
| Packing order (pack-first) | Generate, then confirm the packing option, then `setPackingInformation(packingGroupId)`, then generate placement |
| Box data | Can't be discarded. Editing it after placement is generated means regenerating placement |
| Placement | One confirmation per plan; permanent |
| Transportation | One confirmation per plan. Afterwards no new options can be generated or confirmed |
| Transport inputs | `readyToShipWindow.start` per shipment. Pallets and freight info for pallet quotes. Contact info for partnered pallets |
| Delivery window | Required when an option's `preconditions` lists `CONFIRMED_DELIVERY_WINDOW` (own carrier). Placement must be confirmed first |
| US prep and labels | From 2026-01-01, Amazon prep and item-label services are gone in the US. Owners must be `SELLER` or `NONE` |
| Source address | Changeable only before carriers are confirmed; invalidates transportation options |
| Content updates | Before RECEIVING; at most ±5% or 6 units per SKU per shipment, whichever is greater; can't empty a shipment |
| Expiry | Packing options, placement options, quotes, delivery windows (`validUntil`), and content previews all expire; regenerate |

## Common failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Unknown tool: …` on every inbound tool | Package not loaded, or wrong name | `search` for the real name; enable `fulfillment-inbound` / `fulfillment-inbound-v0` and restart |
| `Provider identity selection is required.` | No seller selected | `list_identities`, ask which seller, `set_active_identity` |
| HTTP 403 `Unauthorized` ("Authorization … is not active") | The seller's app authorization is inactive or lacks the Fulfillment role | Don't retry. The seller re-authorizes in Seller Central or reconnects through the provider |
| HTTP 400 "not supported for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution inbound plans" | AWD plan in the list | Label it AWD and skip |
| `setPackingInformation` rejects `packingGroupId` | Packing option not confirmed yet, or placement already confirmed | Confirm packing first. After placement, key by `shipmentId` |
| No LTL options returned | Pallets or freight info missing | Regenerate with `pallets[]` and `freightInformation` |
| No PCP options seen | Only the first page was read, or Amazon filtered pricier PCP options | Page through all results |
| Transport confirm fails on a delivery window | Precondition not met | Generate, list, and confirm the delivery window first |
| Confirm fails with an expired or invalid option | Option expired | Regenerate and re-present |
| Marketplace/region mismatch | Identity is in a different region (e.g. IN is EU) | Switch identity or region |
| Tracking update rejected | Partnered carrier, or wrong ID format | Tracking is for own carrier only. Small parcel uses box IDs; LTL uses one PRO number in an array |
| Operation `FAILED` | Bad input | Read `operationProblems[]`, fix, and retry the write |
