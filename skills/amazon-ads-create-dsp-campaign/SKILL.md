# Create DSP P+/B+ Campaign

## When to use this skill

- Create a new DSP **Performance+ (P+)** or **Brand+ (B+)** campaign
- Set up automated targeting tactic ad groups under a DSP campaign
- Launch DSP campaigns across DISPLAY, VIDEO_OLV (online video), VIDEO_STV (streaming TV), AUDIO, or LIVE_EVENTS inventory

If the user wants manual targeting (e.g., specific audience or supply targets), this skill does not apply — they need the standard DSP campaign workflow with explicit targets, not the automated tactic workflow.

## Account-context recovery

If Amazon account scope, identifier type, marketplace mapping, or account relationships become unclear, consult `amazon-ads-accounts` when it is available. Resume this skill after resolving the ambiguity. If it is unavailable, use equivalent read-only discovery and ask the user when multiple valid choices remain. Never guess or interchange identifier types.

## Tool-shape conventions for this MCP

 **Read this section before making any tool call** — every payload in the reference files follows these rules.

1. **Tool names use the `allv1_*` prefix.** This server mounts the unified `AdsAPIv1All` spec under the `allv1` prefix, so the hosted MCP's `campaign_management-create_campaign` becomes `allv1_CreateCampaign`, `account_management-query_advertiser_account` becomes `allv1_QueryAdvertiserAccount`, and so on. The full mapping is in the Prerequisites table below.

2. **Flat request body, no `body: {...}` wrapper.** FastMCP flattens the OpenAPI request body when it mounts the spec. The hosted MCP shape `{"body": {"campaigns": [...]}}` becomes `{"campaigns": [...]}` here. Path parameters (when present) are also top-level keys, not nested under `pathParameters`.

3. **No `accessRequestedAccount` field in the body.** This repo's v1 ops declare `Amazon-Ads-AccountId` as a header parameter, not a body field. Pass the DSP advertiser ID as the `Amazon-Ads-AccountId` tool argument. If the active profile already covers this advertiser, this server's auth middleware can inject it automatically, but for DSP work pass it explicitly to avoid scope ambiguity.

4. **No `skill: {skillName, version}` object.** The hosted MCP's per-call skill-telemetry contract is not accepted here. Do not include a `skill` field — it will be rejected as unknown.

5. **Set the active Amazon Ads profile first.** Before any tool call, call `set_active_profile` with the user's `profileId`. This injects the `Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope` header on every downstream request. If you only have an advertiser/account ID, call `page_profiles` or `search_profiles` to find the right `profileId` first.

### Hosted-shape vs this-repo-shape example

Hosted MCP (`campaign_management-create_campaign`):
```json
{
  "body": {
    "accessRequestedAccount": {"advertiserAccountId": "580455376359067392"},
    "campaigns": [{"adProduct": "AMAZON_DSP", "name": "...", ...}]
  },
  "skill": {"skillName": "create-dsp-pb-campaign", "version": "1.0.1"}
}
```

This repo (`allv1_CreateCampaign`):
```json
{
  "Amazon-Ads-AccountId": "580455376359067392",
  "campaigns": [{"adProduct": "AMAZON_DSP", "name": "...", ...}]
}
```

The `campaigns` array element shape is identical — only the wrapping changed.

## Prerequisites

Before executing, verify that the following tools are available. The MCP server may apply its own prefix in some deployment modes; match by suffix.

| Step | Tool needed in this repo | Was on hosted MCP as |
|---|---|---|
| Profile setup | `set_active_profile` | (this repo only) |
| 1 | `allv1_QueryAdvertiserAccount` | `account_management-query_advertiser_account` |
| 2 | `allv1_CreateCampaign` | `campaign_management-create_campaign` |
| 2 verify | `allv1_QueryCampaign` | `campaign_management-query_campaign` |
| 3 | `campconv_DspPostProductConversionTrackingV1` | `campaign_management-dsp_create_conversion_tracking_products` |
| 3 verify | `campconv_DspGetCampaignConversionTrackingProductsV1` | (not on hosted MCP — verification helper from this repo) |
| 4 | `allv1_QueryCampaign` | `campaign_management-query_campaign` |
| 5 | `allv1_CreateAdGroup` | `campaign_management-create_ad_group` |
| 5 verify | `allv1_QueryAdGroup` | `campaign_management-query_ad_group` |
| 6a | `allv1_CreateAd` (optional) | `campaign_management-create_ad` |
| 6a verify | `allv1_QueryAd` (optional) | `campaign_management-query_ad` |
| 6b | `allv1_CreateAdAssociation` (optional) | `campaign_management-create_ad_association` |
| 6b verify | `allv1_QueryAdAssociation` (optional) | `campaign_management-query_ad_association` |
| 7 | `allv1_UpdateCampaign`, `allv1_UpdateAdGroup` | `campaign_management-update_campaign`, `campaign_management-update_ad_group` |

If any required tool is missing for a step the user wants to execute, stop and tell the user which step is unavailable.

## Workflow

```
Profile: set_active_profile(profileId)
Step 0:  Gather and validate inputs
Step 1:  Query advertiser account → extract dspAdvertiserId
Step 2:  Create DSP campaign in PAUSED state (+ verification read)
Step 3:  Attach ASIN conversion tracking (+ verification read)
Step 4:  Re-query campaign → extract eligible tactics (retry if empty)
Step 5:  Create one ad group per eligible (inventoryType, tactic) (+ verification reads)
Step 6:  (Optional) Create ads + ad-group associations (+ verification reads)
Step 7:  Activate campaign → ad groups in strict parent-first order
Step 8:  Present summary
```

| `fees`, `frequencies`, `tags`, `purchaseOrderNumber` | No | Pass-through; include only if the user provided them |

## Step-by-step execution

### Profile setup (do this first)

Call `set_active_profile` with the user's `profileId`. This server validates the ID against the cached profile list and rejects unknown IDs with a helpful suggestion, so a bad ID surfaces here instead of as an opaque 401 downstream.

If the user gave you an advertiser name or DSP account ID but no profile ID, call `page_profiles` (or `search_profiles` if available) first to resolve it, then set the active profile.

### Step 0: Gather and validate inputs

Collect the inputs in the table above, apply defaults, and validate. Full details — including Goal KPI inference, validation rules, and the timestamp pattern used across entity names — are in [references/step0_gather_inputs.md](references/step0_gather_inputs.md).

### Step 1: Query advertiser account → extract `dspAdvertiserId`

See [references/step1_query_account.md](references/step1_query_account.md) for the full request/response shape.

Call `allv1_QueryAdvertiserAccount` with `isGlobalAccountFilter.include = [false]`. From `advertiserAccounts[].alternateIds[]`, extract the `dspAdvertiserId` (this is the numeric ID you will pass as `Amazon-Ads-AccountId` on every subsequent v1 tool call). If multiple non-global accounts come back, select the one whose `region` matches the user's marketplace.

### Step 2: Create the DSP campaign

See [references/step2_create_campaign.md](references/step2_create_campaign.md) for the full parameter table and payload.

Call `allv1_CreateCampaign` with `Amazon-Ads-AccountId = <dspAdvertiserId>` and a body containing a single campaign in `PAUSED` state with one flight covering the date range and budget. Extract `campaignId` from the response.

**Verification read:** After the create call returns, wait 100ms then call `allv1_QueryCampaign` filtered by the new `campaignId`. If the campaign isn't found, retry up to 3 times with 1-second delays. The API is eventually consistent; this verification is what makes the workflow reliable rather than racy.

On verification failure after retries: stop and report. Do not proceed to dependent steps.

### Step 3: Attach ASIN conversion tracking

See [references/step3_conversion_tracking.md](references/step3_conversion_tracking.md) for the full parameter table and payload.

Call `campconv_DspPostProductConversionTrackingV1` with `Amazon-Ads-AccountId = <dspAdvertiserId>`, `campaignId = <campaignId>`, and a `productTrackingList[]` containing one entry per ASIN (each with `productId`, `domain` derived as `AMAZON_{countryCode}`, and `productAssociation = "FEATURED"`). The endpoint accepts 1–2,000 products per call and a campaign can track up to 500,000 products total.

**Verification read:** After the create call returns, wait 100ms then call `campconv_DspGetCampaignConversionTrackingProductsV1` (same `Amazon-Ads-AccountId` + `campaignId`) and confirm the ASINs you sent are now present in the returned `productTrackingList[]`. Retry up to 3 × 1s on miss. This guards Step 4 against the race where eligible-tactic computation hasn't yet seen the products.

On failure: report the error. The workflow can technically continue (the campaign and ad groups don't depend on conversion tracking *creating* — they depend on it being *configured*), but Step 4 will likely return zero eligible P+ tactics until tracking is in place.

### Step 4: Re-query the campaign to extract eligible tactics

See [references/step4_query_eligible_tactics.md](references/step4_query_eligible_tactics.md) for the full request/response shape and reason-code list.

Call `allv1_QueryCampaign` filtered by the new `campaignId` and `adProductFilter.include = ["AMAZON_DSP"]`. The response includes `eligibleAutomatedTargetingTactics[]` and `ineligibleAutomatedTargetingTactics[]`.

**Eventual consistency for tactics:** eligibility is populated asynchronously after Step 3 even though Step 3 itself verified the products landed — the eligibility recomputation has its own propagation lag. If the first query returns zero eligible tactics, wait 100ms and retry up to 3 times with 1-second delays. If still empty after retries, see the reference file for the likely-cause checklist.

Filter eligible tactics by the user's `primaryInventoryTypes`. If a user-requested tactic is ineligible, present the alternatives and let the user decide before continuing.

### Step 5: Create one ad group per eligible (inventoryType, tactic) combo

See [references/step5_create_adgroup.md](references/step5_create_adgroup.md) for the parameter table, the strict allowlist of fields, and the payload.

For each confirmed `(primaryInventoryType, tacticType)` pair:
- Translate `primaryInventoryType` → ad-group `inventoryType` using [references/inventory_type_mapping.md](references/inventory_type_mapping.md) (the API uses different enum names at campaign vs ad-group level for the same concept).
- Call `allv1_CreateAdGroup`. Extract `adGroupId`.
- **Verification read:** Wait 100ms, then `allv1_QueryAdGroup` filtered by the new `adGroupId`. Retry up to 3 × 1s on miss.

P+/B+ tactic ad groups have a strict accepted-field allowlist — including extra fields (`bid`, `budgets`, `pacing`, etc.) will cause the request to be rejected. See the reference for the full list.

### Step 6: (Optional) Create ad + associate with ad group

If the user provided creative details (asset IDs, sizes) or an existing `adId`, proceed. Otherwise, ask:
> "Would you like to set up creatives now, or skip and add them later?"

Skipping is fine — creatives can be added to the ad groups in a later session.

- **Step 6a — Create Ad** ([references/step6a_create_ad.md](references/step6a_create_ad.md)): call `allv1_CreateAd`, verify with `allv1_QueryAd`.
- **Step 6b — Associate Ad with Ad Group** ([references/step6b_create_ad_association.md](references/step6b_create_ad_association.md)): call `allv1_CreateAdAssociation`, verify with `allv1_QueryAdAssociation`.

### Step 7: Activate everything (strict parent-first order)

See [references/step7_activate.md](references/step7_activate.md) for the update payloads.

1. **Activate campaign** — `allv1_UpdateCampaign` with `state: "ENABLED"`
2. **Activate ad groups** — `allv1_UpdateAdGroup` (one per ad group) with `state: "ENABLED"`

If the campaign fails to activate, do **not** attempt to activate its ad groups — the activation would either fail or leave a confusing half-state. Report whatever did succeed.

### Step 8: Summary

Present a structured summary so the user can see exactly what was created and what was skipped. The reference template:

```
DSP P+/B+ Campaign created and activated:
- Profile: <profileId> (<accountName>, <countryCode>)
- DSP Advertiser: <dspAdvertiserId>
- Campaign: "<name>" (ID: <campaignId>) — ENABLED
  Goal KPI: <goal_kpi> | Primary Inventory Types: <primaryInventoryTypes>
- Conversion Tracking: <status — see Step 3>
- Ad Groups:
  - "<name>" (ID: <adGroupId>) — <inventoryType> / <tactic> — ENABLED
  ...
- Skipped Ineligible Tactics:
  - <inventoryType> / <tactic> — reason: <reasonCode>
  ...
- Ads & Associations (if created):
  - Ad "<name>" (ID: <adId>) → Ad Group "<name>" (ID: <adGroupId>) — ENABLED
  [If skipped]: Creatives were not set up. You can add them later.
```

## Example

**User:** "Create a DSP Performance+ campaign for the US marketplace with a $5000 budget, starting tomorrow, targeting ASINs B0EXAMPLE1 and B0EXAMPLE2, using DISPLAY inventory. My profile ID is 1939934761669430."

**Agent:**
1. `set_active_profile("1939934761669430")` — gets back the resolved account name/country.
2. Gathers inputs: marketplace=US, budget=$5000, start=tomorrow, ASINs=[B0EXAMPLE1, B0EXAMPLE2], primaryInventoryTypes=[DISPLAY]. Defaults goal_kpi to `ROAS` (P+ conversions).
3. `allv1_QueryAdvertiserAccount` → extracts dspAdvertiserId from `alternateIds`.
4. `allv1_CreateCampaign` (with `Amazon-Ads-AccountId=<dspAdvertiserId>`) → P+ goal type → extracts `campaignId` → verifies via `allv1_QueryCampaign`.
5. `campconv_DspPostProductConversionTrackingV1` (with `Amazon-Ads-AccountId=<dspAdvertiserId>`, `campaignId`, `productTrackingList=[{B0EXAMPLE1, AMAZON_US, FEATURED}, {B0EXAMPLE2, AMAZON_US, FEATURED}]`) → verifies via `campconv_DspGetCampaignConversionTrackingProductsV1`.
6. `allv1_QueryCampaign` → eligible tactics (e.g., CUSTOMER_ACQUISITION, REMARKETING, RETENTION). Retries with backoff if empty.
7. For each `(DISPLAY, tactic)`: `allv1_CreateAdGroup` → verify with `allv1_QueryAdGroup`.
8. Asks about creatives — user skips.
9. `allv1_UpdateCampaign` → ENABLED. Then each `allv1_UpdateAdGroup` → ENABLED.
10. Presents summary with all IDs.

## Eventual consistency handling

Amazon's v1 Ads API does not guarantee read-after-write consistency. Every write step in this workflow has a verification read pattern: write → wait 100ms → query → retry up to 3 × 1s on miss → fail loudly if still missing.

| Write step | Verification tool |
|---|---|
| Step 2: Create Campaign | `allv1_QueryCampaign` |
| Step 3: Create Conversion Tracking | `campconv_DspGetCampaignConversionTrackingProductsV1` |
| Step 4: Query Eligible Tactics | Retry if zero eligible tactics returned |
| Step 5: Create Ad Group | `allv1_QueryAdGroup` |
| Step 6a: Create Ad | `allv1_QueryAd` |
| Step 6b: Create Ad Association | `allv1_QueryAdAssociation` |

The verification pattern exists because activation (Step 7) immediately follows creation, and the API will reject an update on a record it can't yet see. Without verification you'll see seemingly-random `NOT_FOUND` errors from the activation calls — verification turns "racy" into "deterministic with a small added latency".

Total worst-case added latency per step: ~3.1s (100ms initial + 3 × 1s retries). Acceptable for a workflow that's already multiple seconds end-to-end.

## Error handling

| Step | Behavior on failure |
|---|---|
| Profile setup | Stop. Ask user to provide a valid `profileId` (the validation error includes did-you-mean suggestions). |
| 1 (account query) | Stop on failure. Report which account types were returned (if any). |
| 2 (create campaign) | Stop on failure. |
| 3 (conversion tracking) | Stop on failure if no ASINs were tracked. If only some succeeded (partial batch), report which ASINs failed and let the user decide whether to continue with the partial list or stop. |
| 4 (query tactics) | Stop on failure. If zero eligible after retries, most likely cause is the campaign's `goal_kpi` doesn't match any tactic of the requested `primaryInventoryType` — re-check Step 0's tactic↔KPI table. |
| 5 (create ad groups) | Stop on the first failure; report which `(inventoryType, tactic)` failed and why. |
| 6 (create ad + association) | Optional — skip if user defers creatives. If attempted and fails, stop and report. |
| 7 (activation) | Report what activated and what didn't. If campaign activation fails, skip ad-group activation. |
| All verification reads | Retry up to 3 × 1s, then fail loudly with the entity ID that couldn't be verified. |

Common error codes from the v1 API: `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (usually a body field that shouldn't be there — re-check the Step 5 allowlist), `UNAUTHORIZED`/`FORBIDDEN` (wrong profile or wrong `Amazon-Ads-AccountId`), `THROTTLED` (back off and retry).
