# Amazon Ads Reporting

Build and operate Amazon Ads unified/v1 reports without guessing fields or account identifiers. The package contains canonical CreateReport templates for 17 reproducible Sponsored Products (SP), Sponsored Brands (SB), and Sponsored Display (SD) report families, plus an explicit non-reproducible entry for SB Category Benchmark.

## Account-context recovery

If Amazon account scope, identifier type, marketplace mapping, or account relationships become unclear, consult `amazon-ads-accounts` when it is available. Resume this skill after resolving the ambiguity. If it is unavailable, use equivalent read-only discovery and ask the user when multiple valid choices remain. Never guess or interchange identifier types.

## Route the request

1. **Named legacy report:** Read [the report catalog](references/report-catalog.md), match both ad product and report family, then load only the named template and its linked mapping reference.
2. **Ambiguous name:** List the matching catalog rows and ask the user to choose. A report family such as “campaign,” “keyword,” or “targeting” is not enough when multiple products or variants match.
3. **Unsupported named report:** State that the package has no validated mapping. Return no speculative CreateReport body.
4. **SB Category Benchmark:** Read its catalog reference, explain the current alternatives, and return no v1-equivalent body.
5. **Metrics and grain rather than a named report:** Read [ad-hoc reporting](references/ad-hoc-reporting.md) and construct a field list from the live catalog.

Use another workflow for AMC SQL, legacy v3 endpoint execution, current campaign settings, or campaign changes.

## Prepare the report

Read [request and delivery workflow](references/workflow.md) before producing or submitting a request. Its invariants are mandatory:

- Resolve an `advertiserAccountId` for unified/v1 reporting. A numeric marketplace profile ID is a related identifier, not a substitute. Apply the account-context recovery guidance above when mapping is required.
- Replace every account and date placeholder. Never submit `REPLACE_ME`, `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`, or prior-year placeholders.
- Preserve each template’s `fields`, `format`, and `adProduct.value` filter unless the user asks to customize them.
- Validate every constructed or modified field list against the current reporting catalog before submission. A bundled, unmodified template may use its packaged validation record.
- Treat each object in a multi-report wrapper as a separate CreateReport request and explain the client-side join.
- Remove documentation-only keys such as `_comment` from submitted bodies.

## External operations

Generating a request is offline. Creating a report job, polling Amazon, and downloading data require a configured integration and the correct advertiser-account scope.

Before creating a report job, show or summarize the resolved account, dates, grain, fields, filters, and number of requests. Submit only when the user asked for live execution or approves that concrete request. Report creation does not authorize campaign or account changes.

Use the integration’s current schema and status values. Poll with bounded backoff or the host’s task/wait facility; stop at the integration’s timeout or the user’s requested deadline. Preserve the report ID so a later turn can resume. Treat download URLs as short-lived and avoid exposing credentials or signed URLs unnecessarily.

## Response contract

For every catalog mapping:

- name the legacy report and the unified/v1 mapping;
- return a directly submittable JSON body for each request, or clearly label an offline template that still contains placeholders;
- identify fields that do not reproduce, fields derived client-side, required joined reports and join keys, and ad-product-specific semantics;
- distinguish an empty completed result from a failed or still-processing report;
- state whether the work stopped at generation, submission, retrieval, or download.

For ad-hoc reports, state the selected time dimension, level-of-detail dimensions, metrics, currency dimension when applicable, and any compatibility-driven split.

## Resources

- [Report catalog](references/report-catalog.md): named-report routing, templates, mapping references, and split-report join keys.
- [Ad-hoc reporting](references/ad-hoc-reporting.md): field discovery and validation when no named report matches.
- [Request and delivery workflow](references/workflow.md): account resolution, canonical body shape, submission, polling, and download safety.
- `references/reports/<product>/<report>.md`: detailed v3-to-v1 mappings and report-specific caveats.
- `assets/templates/<product>/<report>.json`: canonical request templates. Wrapper files contain multiple named requests and are not themselves submittable.
