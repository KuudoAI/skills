# Sponsored Brands Search Term Impression Share partial mapping

*Partial replacement for v3 Sponsored_Brands_Search_Term_Impression_Share_report — 17 of 19 columns reproducible*

## Summary

This template is a PARTIAL replacement for the v3 Sponsored Brands Search Term Impression Share report on the Amazon Ads API v1 cross-product reporting endpoint.

**CRITICAL: 2 of 19 v3 columns — 'Search Term Impression Rank' and 'Search Term Impression Share' — have NO v1 equivalent and CANNOT be obtained from this endpoint. The remaining 17 columns map cleanly. To recover the missing rank/share columns, use Amazon Marketing Stream's 'sb-search-term-impression-share' dataset or the legacy v2 SB reporting endpoint.**

The 20-field payload was validated against the packaged v1 catalog: zero unknown fields, zero missing required, zero incompatible pairs.

Why per-search-term rank and share are missing

The v1 catalog has metric.impressionShare and metric.impressionShareRank, and their compatibility flags say they CAN coexist with searchTerm.value. But the canonical metric descriptions are explicit: 'The percentage share of all your impressions compared to all other advertisers' and 'The numeric rank of your account-wide impression share compared to all other advertisers'. These are ACCOUNT-WIDE aggregates, not per-search-term competitive metrics. Including them in a search-term-grain report produces the same constant value on every row — which is not what the v3 'Search Term Impression Rank/Share' columns measure.

Validator probes for the per-search-term metrics confirm: metric.searchTermImpressionRank, metric.searchTermImpressionShare, metric.searchTermImpressionShareRank, and metric.searchTermRank are all UNKNOWN to the v1 catalog. The catalog suggests the account-wide replacements but warns indirectly via the description text.

Recommended recovery paths

-   Amazon Marketing Stream — 'sb-search-term-impression-share' dataset. Real-time streaming, indexed per search term per campaign. Closest functional equivalent.

-   Legacy v2 SB Reporting endpoint — sb/searchTerm reportType continues to expose searchTermImpressionRank and searchTermImpressionShare for SB campaigns. Slower-moving than v1's catalog improvements but still supported as of catalog parse 2026-04-18.

-   If neither is available: drop the rank/share columns and surface only the 17 reproducible columns. The use case (find low-rank search terms to bid up) can be approximated downstream by joining searchTerm.value impressions against historical maxima per campaign.

| TWO v3 COLUMNS ARE NOT REPRODUCIBLE in v1                         | 'Search Term Impression Rank' and 'Search Term Impression Share' have no v1 equivalent. The v1 catalog has metric.impressionShare and metric.impressionShareRank, but their canonical descriptions explicitly say 'account-wide' — they are NOT per-search-term metrics. Validator-confirmed unknown for metric.searchTermImpressionRank, metric.searchTermImpressionShare, metric.searchTermImpressionShareRank. To recover these two columns, use Amazon Marketing Stream's 'sb-search-term-impression-share' dataset (real-time stream) or the legacy v2 SB reporting endpoint. |
| The other 17 v3 columns ARE reproducible at the search-term grain | All delivery (Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Spend, CPC), all conversion (Sales/Orders + click-only variants, Conversion Rate, ROAS-Click, ACOS-Click derived) map cleanly.

## Operational notes

-   If you need a complete replacement and Marketing Stream is available, set up the sb-search-term-impression-share subscription first; the v1 partial report can then complement it with longer-window aggregates.


-   Conversion rate definition: metric.purchaseRateOverClicks for orders/clicks (typical SB UI default); metric.purchaseRate for purchases/impressions.
