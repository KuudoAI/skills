# Sponsored Brands Attributed Purchases mapping

*Equivalent to v3 Sponsored_Brands_Attributed_Purchases_report — 18 v3 columns mapped (with attribution-type restructured into metric variants)*

## Summary

This template replicates the v3 Sponsored Brands Attributed Purchases report on the Amazon Ads API v1 cross-product reporting endpoint (CreateReport). The grain is (date, campaign, purchased ASIN) with attribution split — but unlike v3 where 'Attribution type' is a row-level dimension, v1 encodes click-vs-view in metric variants, so the v1 layout is wider rows with click-only and total columns side-by-side.

Of the 18 v3 columns: 14 map cleanly to v1 fields, 1 is restructured (Attribution type → metric variants), and 3 are derived client-side (% of Sales NTB, % of Units NTB are derived; ACOS isn't applicable to this report).

The 17-field payload was validated against the packaged v1 catalog: zero unknown fields, zero missing required, zero incompatible pairs.

Why this report has the same constraints as SP Purchased Product

Like the SP Purchased Product report, this is a HALO-style report whose grain pins down the actual purchased ASIN (convertedProduct.id). v1's catalog explicitly marks metric.impressions, metric.clicks, and metric.totalCost as INCOMPATIBLE with the convertedProduct.\* family — and that's why the v3 SB Attributed Purchases report omits Impressions/Clicks/Spend/CTR/CPC. v3 hid this constraint by giving you a sparse 18-column conversion-only report; v1 surfaces it via the validator.

**This report's primary use case is decomposition: showing which Purchased ASINs an SB campaign drove sales for, and how much of that was new-to-brand. v1 covers this use case completely — but with one validator-detected restriction (the percent-of-sales NTB metric is blocked when grouping by purchased ASIN). The percent-of-purchases NTB variant survives, and the missing percentages are simple downstream divisions.**

Layout difference: attribution type

In v3, 'Attribution type' is a column with values like 'Total' (all-attribution = click + view) and 'Click'. Each combination of (date, campaign, attribution type, purchased ASIN) is one row. So a single (date, campaign, ASIN) appears in TWO rows — one with the totals, one with the click-only numbers.

In v1 the same data is one wider row per (date, campaign, ASIN) with both metric.sales (total) and metric.salesFromClicks (click-only) populated together. This is the same shape v3 reports like SB Keyword and SB Search Term use for their click-only variants. It is generally cleaner for downstream warehouses — joins and pivots get simpler when click-vs-view is on the same row.

If your downstream consumers absolutely require the v3 long-format shape, UNION the rows in the warehouse: SELECT ..., 'Total' as attribution_type, sales as col_value FROM v1 UNION ALL SELECT ..., 'Click' as attribution_type, salesFromClicks as col_value FROM v1. Same for purchases and unitsSold.

Click-vs-view attribution is encoded in the \*FromClicks vs \*FromViews metric variants instead. The v3 layout (one row per attribution type with metrics per row) becomes a v1 layout (one row per date+campaign+convertedProduct.id with click and total columns side-by-side). v3's 'View' attribution = (total - clicks-only); v1 surfaces both metric.sales (total = click+view) and metric.salesFromClicks (click-only) on the same row. |

| v3 'Attribution type' is NOT a dimension in v1                                       | v1 has no attribution-type dimension. Click-vs-view is encoded in metric variants: metric.salesFromClicks vs metric.salesFromViews vs metric.sales (total = click + view). The v3 layout (one row per attribution type) becomes a v1 layout (one row per (date, campaign, convertedProduct.id) with click-only and total metrics on the same row). v3's 'View' attribution = total − click — derive in the warehouse if downstream consumers expect three rows per group. |
| This is a HALO-style report — most metrics are forbidden at this grain               | Same constraint as the SP Purchased Product report: convertedProduct.id is incompatible with metric.impressions, metric.clicks, and metric.totalCost. Only conversion-event metrics (sales, purchases, unitsSold and their \*FromClicks / \*FromViews / \*NewToBrand variants) coexist with convertedProduct.id.                                                                                                                                                          |

All Halo and Promoted variants of the SALES NTB% are also incompatible. Workaround: derive percent-of-sales-NTB downstream as newToBrandSales / NULLIF(sales, 0). The percent-of-units-NTB has no v1 field anywhere — derive as newToBrandUnitsSold / NULLIF(unitsSold, 0).                                            |
| convertedProduct.id requires convertedProductMarketplace.value as a supporting field | Validator surfaced this requirement on probe — convertedProductMarketplace.value must be in the field list when convertedProduct.id is.

## Operational notes

-   Reproducing the v3 long-format attribution shape: UNION two SELECT statements over the v1 wide-format result. v3 'Total' = metric.sales; v3 'Click' = metric.salesFromClicks; v3 'View' (if present in your downstream consumers) = metric.sales − metric.salesFromClicks (or use metric.salesFromViews directly — also compatible with convertedProduct.id).

-   Adding metric.salesFromViews / metric.purchasesFromViews / metric.unitsSoldFromViews: all three are compatible with convertedProduct.id and provide the view-only column directly. Add them if your warehouse prefers explicit view metrics over (total − clicks).

-   Enriching with brand/category: convertedProduct.brand, convertedProduct.category, convertedProduct.subcategory, convertedProduct.parentProductId, convertedProduct.productGroup are all compatible with this metric set. Add convertedProduct.brand to roll halo purchases up by brand.

-   Derivations: percentOfSalesNewToBrand = newToBrandSales / NULLIF(sales, 0); percentOfUnitsNewToBrand = newToBrandUnitsSold / NULLIF(unitsSold, 0). Persist raw inputs alongside the derived views.
