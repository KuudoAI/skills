# Amazon Ads Accounts

## Overview

Resolve account context from the scope the next operation requires. Advertiser, profile, and manager identifiers represent different layers and are not interchangeable.

This skill covers identity, discovery, selection, and read-only relationships. Route creation, registration, terms acceptance, updates, association, and disassociation to an administration or onboarding workflow.

## Route the Request

| Request | Read |
|---|---|
| Explain IDs, list accounts, or select an account and marketplace | [Identifiers and scopes](references/identifiers-and-scopes.md) |
| Explain manager accounts or inspect parent, child, and linked-account relationships | [Account relationships](references/account-relationships.md) |

Load only the reference needed for the request. A conceptual question may be answered from the quick reference below without making an API call.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Identifier | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Advertiser account | `advertiserAccountId` | Unified advertiser identity across products and regions. Global IDs start with `amzn1.ads-account.g.`. |
| Profile | `profileId` | Numeric marketplace-specific alternate scope used by APIs that still require a profile. One advertiser may have several. |
| Entity | `entityId` | Alternate or legacy reference, often beginning with `ENTITY`. |
| DSP advertiser | `dspAdvertiserId` | An alternate DSP identifier. Use it only when a tool explicitly requests it. |
| Manager account | `managerAccountId` | Access/grouping node beginning with `amzn1.ads1.ma1.`. |

## Resolve Account Context

1. Identify the exact identifier type required by the downstream tool.
2. Reuse connection-provided context when it supplies that type.
3. Otherwise, use the relevant read-only discovery tool.
4. For multiple matches, present names, IDs, and marketplaces and ask the user to choose.
5. For multiple marketplace profiles, use the requested country or ask which applies.
6. State and retain the selection for the current session.

Never guess an identifier or substitute one identifier type for another. Check only the discovery tool needed for the selected branch; an unavailable unrelated account tool does not block the request.

## Tool-call Attribution

Include this object in each Amazon Ads tool call made as part of this skill:

```json
{
  "skill": {
    "skillName": "amazon-ads-accounts",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Example

For “Which profile should I use for our UK ads?”, resolve the advertiser account, inspect `alternateIds`, and select the `GB` entry's numeric `profileId`. Present choices if more than one account or UK profile remains plausible.

## Common Mistakes

- Substituting `profileId`, `entityId`, and `advertiserAccountId` for one another.
- Assuming one advertiser account has only one profile.
- Searching only global accounts when the account may be legacy or regional.
- Treating a manager account as campaign or reporting scope.
