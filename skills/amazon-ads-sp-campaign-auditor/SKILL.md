description: Use when auditing Sponsored Products campaign portfolio structure through Amazon Ads MCP, including spend concentration, budget utilization, delivery gaps, low-engagement campaigns, targeting-type mix, or campaign naming hygiene.
compatibility: Requires a configured Amazon Ads MCP connection with reporting access. Account discovery and report creation depend on the tools and schemas exposed by that server.

# Sponsored Products campaign auditor

## Purpose

Produce a read-only, portfolio-level audit from Sponsored Products campaign data obtained through Amazon Ads MCP. Measure structure and delivery, explain uncertainty, and identify review candidates. Do not create, update, pause, archive, or otherwise mutate campaigns.

## Account-context recovery

If Amazon account scope, identifier type, marketplace mapping, or account relationships become unclear, consult `amazon-ads-accounts` when it is available. Resume this skill after resolving the ambiguity. If it is unavailable, use equivalent read-only discovery and ask the user when multiple valid choices remain. Never guess or interchange identifier types.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect the connection.** Confirm that the configured Amazon Ads MCP exposes the account-discovery and reporting operations needed for this audit. Use the actual exposed tool names and schemas; do not invent aliases. Read [the live-reporting reference](references/mcp-canonical-fields.md) before requesting data.
2. **Resolve scope.** Establish the identity, advertiser account/profile, region, marketplace, and currency. Confirm the date range and the questions the audit should answer. Ask only for choices that materially change extraction or interpretation.
3. **Define the report.** Discover the current report-field catalog, choose Sponsored Products campaign dimensions and metrics, and validate the complete field set before creating the report. Record the exact accepted field IDs.
4. **Retrieve safely.** Create the report and retain its report ID. Follow the MCP's asynchronous status contract. Avoid tight polling; when the client cannot wait safely, return the report ID and resume retrieval when the user continues.
5. **Establish grain.** Inspect the returned rows before calculating metrics. Aggregate campaign-day rows to campaigns; sum additive metrics and treat budget according to its type and time grain.
6. **Apply the audit.** Read [the audit rules](references/audit-rules-and-thresholds.md). Use user-provided targets or operating standards when available. Without them, report distributions and review candidates rather than declaring a universal ideal.
7. **Deliver the result.** Follow [the report template](references/report-template.md). Mark unsupported sections `N/A` with the missing field or ambiguity, instead of estimating absent values.

## Interpretation contract

- Separate **observations** from **diagnostic hypotheses** and **recommendations**.
- Cite the value, formula, population, window, and threshold behind every numeric flag.
- Treat campaign naming as a heuristic until the user confirms the taxonomy.
- Treat report-side `campaign.deliveryStatus` as a delivery-status proxy, not the campaign-management state. Say which source supports any enabled/paused count.
- Compare spend with budget only when budget type, time grain, and denominator cover the same period.
- Frame zero-delivery and low-engagement results as investigation queues. Eligibility, targeting, bids, budgets, seasonality, launch timing, and inventory can all affect delivery.
- Keep recommendations reversible and evidence-linked. This skill reports proposed next actions; it does not execute them.

## Reference routing

| Need | Read |
|------|------|
| Resolve account context, discover fields, create/retrieve a report, or interpret live status | [references/mcp-canonical-fields.md](references/mcp-canonical-fields.md) |
| Calculate concentration, budget fill, delivery gaps, targeting mix, or duplicate-name groups | [references/audit-rules-and-thresholds.md](references/audit-rules-and-thresholds.md) |
| Structure the final audit | [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md) |

## Completion criteria

The audit is complete when it:

- identifies the account context, date range, currency, report ID, row grain, and exact field set;
- reports each requested section or marks it `N/A` with a reason;
- states every threshold and classification rule used;
- distinguishes facts, hypotheses, and recommendations; and
- leaves the Amazon Ads account unchanged.
