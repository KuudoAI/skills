# The creative assets API through the Amazon Ads MCP

How a finished file becomes a usable `assetId`. This is the operational half
of the skill: registration, the upload gap, versioning, status, and search.
The specs and policy that decide whether the file *should* be uploaded live in
[`01-asset-specs.md`](01-asset-specs.md) and
[`02-creative-policy.md`](02-creative-policy.md).

Drive the **Amazon Ads MCP server**, not the REST API directly. Amazon's
documentation is written as curl against `advertising-api.amazon.com`;
translate those calls into MCP tools rather than reproducing them. Where the
MCP tool schemas and error responses disagree with the published docs, the MCP
is authoritative — see [Known discrepancies](#known-discrepancies).

## The MCP surface

The Amazon Ads MCP uses code-mode meta-tools:

- `amazon_ads_v4:search(query, detail, limit, tags)` — find tools
- `amazon_ads_v4:get_schema(tools, detail)` — get parameter schemas
- `amazon_ads_v4:execute(code)` — run `await call_tool(name, params)` in
  Python; chain several calls in one block and `return` the final value

Always `get_schema` before a first call to an unfamiliar tool. Do not assume
parameter names.

| Purpose | Tool |
|---|---|
| Create upload location | `creat_getUploadLocation` |
| Register asset | `creat_registerAsset` |
| Register many (async) | `creat_assetsBatchRegister` → `creat_getAssetsBatchRegister` |
| Retrieve asset and versions | `creat_getAsset` |
| Search assets | `creat_searchAssets` |
| Brand entity ID lookup | `sb_getBrands` |
| Sponsored Brands direct byte upload | `sb_createAsset` |
| SB media polling | `sb_completeUpload`, `sb_describeMedia` |

## The three-call flow, and the gap in the middle

Registering an asset takes three steps. **The MCP can only do two of them.**

1. `creat_getUploadLocation` → an ephemeral S3 URL, PUT-only, expires in
   15 minutes
2. **PUT the raw bytes to that URL** — no MCP tool does this
3. `creat_registerAsset` → returns `assetId`

Step 2 is a plain HTTP PUT with a raw binary body and a matching
`Content-Type` header. It is **not** multipart and has no form field name.
`amazon_ads_v4:execute` runs Python with only `call_tool` in scope — no HTTP
client — so the agent cannot perform this step through the Ads MCP. Nothing
else in the catalog performs an upload either — that was checked across the
full tool surface (roughly 734 tools at the time of writing), so it is a real
gap rather than a missing tool name.

**Say this to the user up front** when they ask to upload something. Do not
mint an upload location and then discover the gap; the URL expires in
15 minutes and a stale one wastes a round trip. Establish first how the bytes
will move:

- the user runs the PUT themselves (curl, script, or their own tooling)
- an agent with shell or HTTP access does it — but it must be able to *reach*
  both the source file and the S3 URL
- the file is already at a public URL and their pipeline fetches it

Then hand back the upload URL, wait for confirmation the PUT returned 200, and
register.

### `registerAsset` takes the upload URL, not a new one

The `url` parameter of `creat_registerAsset` is the **same URL** returned by
`creat_getUploadLocation`. There is no separate canonical URL issued after
upload. Keep the URL from step 1; you need it in step 3.

## Registration parameters

| Parameter | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | yes | The step-1 upload URL |
| `name` | yes | Asset name |
| `assetType` | yes | `IMAGE` or `VIDEO` |
| `assetSubTypeList` | yes | See enum below |
| `asinList` | no | **Applied as searchable tags** — see below |
| `tags` | no | Free-form tags for search |
| `versionInfo` | no | Object: `{"linkedAssetId": "<existing assetId>"}` — registers a new version |
| `associatedSubEntityList` | **yes for sellers** | `brandEntityId`; get it from `sb_getBrands`. Recommended for everyone |
| `registrationContext` | **yes for DSP** | Not needed for sponsored ads or Stores |
| `skipAssetSubTypesDetection` | no | `true` pins your subtype; otherwise the system may reclassify |

`assetSubTypeList` values: `LOGO`, `PRODUCT_IMAGE`, `AUTHOR_IMAGE`,
`LIFESTYLE_IMAGE`, `OTHER_IMAGE`, `BACKGROUND_VIDEO`.

The subtype should match what the creative actually is, which is the same
distinction the specs turn on: a `LIFESTYLE_IMAGE` is the custom image with no
burned-in branding, while `LOGO` is the separate 1:1 asset. See the program
routing table in [`01-asset-specs.md`](01-asset-specs.md#program-routing).

**ASINs are not just metadata.** An ASIN passed at registration becomes a tag
on the asset, making it retrievable via the `ASIN` value filter in
`creat_searchAssets`. If the user is generating creative for a specific
product, always pass the ASIN — it is the join key they will want later, and
it cannot be added as conveniently after the fact.

## Reading the registration response

A 200 does **not** mean the asset is usable. The response carries:

- `assetId` — e.g. `amzn1.assetlibrary.asset1.xxxxx`
- `versionId` — e.g. `version_v1`
- `failedSpecChecks` — **an array that is often non-empty on success**
- `programPolicyValidationsList`

`failedSpecChecks` lists the programs the asset is *not* eligible for, each
with a `specProgramName` and per-check detail (`actualValue`, `arguments`,
`failureReason`, `isPassed`, `stringId`). An asset registered for Sponsored
Brands will routinely fail DSP OLV, DSP OTT, and Stores intro-splash checks
and still be perfectly fine for its intended use.

**Interpret this against the user's target program, not as a pass/fail.**
Report which programs failed and why, then ask what the asset is for if they
have not said. Announcing "your asset failed validation" when it failed only
for programs they are not using is a false alarm — and it is the same
program-scoping question the whole skill turns on.

## Status: processing is not moderation

After registration the asset is `PROCESSING`. It cannot be used in a campaign
until `ACTIVE`.

- Poll `creat_getAsset` until status is `ACTIVE`
- Processing can take **up to 30 minutes**; video is routinely longer because
  it includes transcoding
- If transcoding fails the asset goes to `INACTIVE`
- Asset library processing is **separate from ad policy moderation**. An
  `ACTIVE` asset can still be rejected later for creative policy violations —
  that review takes up to 72 hours and is what
  [`02-creative-policy.md`](02-creative-policy.md) governs
- Amazon does **not** check image eligibility at this stage

Set expectations before the user sits watching a poll loop. For video, tell
them 30 minutes is normal and offer to check back rather than polling
continuously.

## Versioning

Every update produces a new version under the **same `assetId`**, with the
version number incrementing (`version_v1` → `version_v2`). Prefer versioning
over creating a separate asset when the user is iterating on the same
creative — it preserves campaign references and history.

The flow is identical to creating an asset — new upload URL, PUT the bytes —
except that step 3 carries `versionInfo`:

```
versionInfo: { "linkedAssetId": "amzn1.assetlibrary.asset1.xxxxx" }
```

Note the shape: an object with `linkedAssetId`, not a bare `assetId` string.

### The silent no-op: the filename must change

**The uploaded file must have a different name than the file in the current
version.** If the filename is the same, Amazon returns the existing `assetId`
and version and **no new version is created**. The response looks successful —
same 200, same `assetId` — so this fails silently.

This is a real trap for generated creative, where a pipeline naturally writes
`hero.png` every time. Before registering a new version, confirm the filename
differs from the previous version's, and if the user reports "my update didn't
take," check this first. Version the filename (`hero-v2.png`, or append a
timestamp or content hash) rather than relying on the bytes being different —
the rule is about the name.

### Referencing a specific version

Creatives reference the composite form `assetId:versionId`:

```
amzn1.assetlibrary.asset1.xxxxx:version_v2
```

Use that when handing an asset to a creative-creation call, so the creative
pins the version the user actually reviewed rather than drifting to whatever
is latest.

## Retrieval and search

`creat_getAsset` takes an `assetId` and returns a single asset. Omit `version`
to get all versions; supply it to get one.

`creat_searchAssets` with an **empty request body returns every asset on the
profile** — the right first call when the user asks what they already have. It
supports:

- **Value filters:** `TAG`, `ASIN`, `CAMPAIGN_NAME`, `CAMPAIGN_ID`, `PROGRAM`,
  `ASSET_TYPE`, `ASSET_SUB_TYPE`, `APPROVED_AD_POLICY`, `ASSET_EXTENSION`
- **Range filters:** file size in bytes, creation timestamp in milliseconds
- **Sort:** `CREATED_TIME`, `SIZE`, `NAME`, `IMAGE_HEIGHT`, `IMAGE_WIDTH`,
  `EXTENSION`
- **Paging:** size 1–500 (default 25), token-based
- **Free text:** matches asset name, name prefix, tags, and associated ASINs

`APPROVED_AD_POLICY` is the filter that makes an automated pipeline possible —
register, poll, then act only on what passed.

Retrieved assets carry `storageLocationUrls` with processed renditions:
`IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_500` for images, and for video `VIDEO_DEFAULT_OPTIMIZED`,
`PRODUCT_VIDEO_OPTIMIZED`, `VIDEO_TILE`, `BACKGROUND_VIDEO_TILE`,
`INTRO_SPLASH`, plus named MP4 encode profiles. This is how you get an image
back out of the library.

## The Sponsored Brands alternative

`sb_createAsset` accepts binary content **inline** — the one path that avoids
the PUT gap. It takes `Content-Disposition` (filename), `Content-Type`,
`asset` (binary), and an `assetInfo` JSON with mediaType and optional brand
entity ID.

Constraints: **under 1 MB**, minimum **400 × 400**, and it lands in the Store
Assets Library rather than the creative asset library. Worth offering when the
file is small and the use is Sponsored Brands, but check the size first —
typical generated images exceed 1 MB, and custom images are allowed up to 5 MB
precisely because they are large.

## Known discrepancies

Verify against a live call before relying on any of these.

- **`filename` vs `fileName`.** The MCP schema names the upload parameter
  `fileName`; Amazon's guide shows a request body using `filename`. If one is
  rejected, try the other.
- **`INACTIVE` is undocumented in the schema.** The OpenAPI `caAssetStatus`
  enum is `[ACTIVE, PROCESSING, ARCHIVED]`, but the guide states a failed
  transcode moves the asset to `INACTIVE`. Handle it defensively.
- **`assetSubTypeList` requiredness.** The guide marks it required; the MCP
  schema does not. Always send it.
- **`creat_getUploadLocation` is mis-annotated** `readOnlyHint: true,
  idempotentHint: true` despite creating a resource. Tooling that gates on
  write annotations will let it through.
- **The `fileName` pattern is not a validator.**
  `[\w]+\.jpg|png|mp4|mov|wmv|avi` is an ungrouped alternation and JSON Schema
  patterns are unanchored, so `avi_notes.txt` passes. Validate extensions
  yourself. An unsupported extension does not error at step 1 — it fails
  later, after the upload.
- **Vendor media types.** Responses use
  `application/vnd.creativeassetsuploadresponse.v3+json`.

## Not available through this API

- **Sponsored Products video.** There are no `sp_` creative or asset
  endpoints. SP video is uploaded through the Ads Console only and cannot be
  automated through this API.
- **Attaching assets to ads.** Registration produces an `assetId`; creating
  the creative that uses it is a separate family of calls
  (`sb_CreateProductCollectionCreative`, `sb_CreateVideoCreative`, and so on).
- **Spec and policy validation before upload.** The API links out to Amazon's
  ad-specs pages rather than enforcing them, which is why the validation
  checklist in [`03-image-generation.md`](03-image-generation.md) runs before
  any of this.

## Permissions

These operations require one of `amazon_stores_edit`,
`advertiser_campaign_edit`, `creatives_edit`, `creatives_view`,
`campaign_view`, `campaign_edit`. DSP accounts are scoped via the
`Amazon-Ads-AccountId` header. A 403 on the upload URL usually means expiry,
not permissions.
