# Handoff: the asset manifest

What this skill hands to whatever runs next — a generating agent, an uploader,
the Amazon Ads MCP, or a human reviewer. The point of a structured handoff is
that the consumer should not have to re-derive which spec an asset was built
to, or guess whether anyone checked it for burned-in text.

## Why a manifest rather than loose files

An image alone doesn't say which program it targets, and the same 1200 × 628
JPEG is compliant for one program and rejected for another. The manifest
carries that intent, the spec it was built against, and the validation
evidence, so an uploader can fail fast instead of spending a review cycle.

## Shape

Adapt field names to whatever the consuming system actually expects; the
content is what matters.

  },

}
```

## Rules for filling it in

- **Never mark a validation field `true` without checking.** A false positive
  here is worse than a null, because it stops a human from looking.
- **Record what you could not verify** in `open_risks` — a claim you have no
  substantiation for, a landing page you couldn't read, a logo whose rights
  you can't confirm. These are the items a human must clear.
- **Keep the prompt and references.** Regeneration after a rejection is
  routine, and reproducibility saves the second cycle.
- **`built_to_spec` points at the section that governed the file**, so a
  reviewer can check the number rather than trusting it.

## Working with the Amazon Ads MCP

The manifest is the input to registration. The mechanics of that —
`creat_getUploadLocation`, the HTTP PUT the MCP cannot perform,
`creat_registerAsset`, versioning, and search — are in
[`07-assets-api-mcp.md`](07-assets-api-mcp.md). Carry `asins` through to
registration, where they become searchable tags, and keep the manifest's
`generation` block, because regeneration after a rejection is routine.

Two behaviours worth keeping:

- **Pre-moderate in bulk when the surface allows it.** Amazon supports
  submitting assets for approval before they are used in a campaign, and the
  asset library can be filtered by moderation status. That turns a 72-hour
  campaign-blocking rejection into an early, cheap signal.
- **Poll moderation status rather than assuming approval.** Review takes up to
  72 hours, and an ad is not live because an upload succeeded.
