# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions are semver and
must match `metadata.version` in SKILL.md.

Bump rules: **patch** = non-behavioral (typos, formatting, reference-only
edits) · **minor** = behavioral additions (new sections, rules, triggers) ·
**major** = contract changes (response shape, output format, scope).
Every bump also updates `evals/evals.json` `skill_version`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Logo **content** rules (registered logo, fills the frame or white/transparent
  background, legible text, no combined logos, not a product image) now appear
  in SKILL.md next to the logo dimensions. Class A defect: an eval asking for a
  logo spec sheet returned only size, ratio, and file limits, because the
  content rules lived exclusively in references 01 and 02.

### Changed
- Eval 1 assertion `advises-reading-rejection-reason` renamed to
  `grounds-fix-in-stated-reason` and broadened. Class B clarification: the
  prompt already quotes the rejection reasons, so instructing the user to go
  read them is not observable behavior. The assertion now tests the real
  standard — that the diagnosis is grounded in the stated reasons rather than
  guessed — and still accepts advising a console check for full detail.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- `references/07-assets-api-mcp.md` — the creative assets API through the
  Amazon Ads MCP, folded in from the repo's standalone `amazon-ads-create`
  operational notes: the code-mode meta-tool surface, the three-call
  registration flow and the HTTP PUT gap the MCP cannot perform, registration
  parameters, reading `failedSpecChecks` against the target program, status
  polling, versioning including the same-filename silent no-op, search
  filters and renditions, the Sponsored Brands inline path, known
  discrepancies, and permissions.
- SKILL.md "Getting assets into Amazon" section and workflow steps 7-8
  (register, track), so the skill now spans brief through registration
  rather than stopping at handoff.
- Three eval cases (14 assertions) for the operational half: the upload gap,
  the `failedSpecChecks` false alarm, and the filename no-op.

### Changed
- Description and compatibility now cover asset registration triggers
  (assetId, assetSubType, failedSpecChecks, PROCESSING, upload URL, asset
  library) alongside the creative-production triggers.
- Tooling guidance names the real code-mode meta-tools and `creat_*` / `sb_*`
  tools, and records that no tool performs the byte upload.
- `references/06-handoff-contract.md` now hands off into the registration
  reference instead of describing the MCP generically.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Initial release, image-first, built to inform a creative-generating agent
  and an Amazon Ads MCP.
- SKILL.md router organised around the program-routing question, since text
  and logo rules invert between Sponsored Brands / Sponsored Display / DSP
  component-based creative (no burned-in branding) and eCommerce REC /
  finished banners (branding required).
- `references/01-asset-specs.md` — dimensions, file-size caps, and formats
  per program, plus a section documenting where Amazon's own published
  numbers conflict and which value is safe.
- `references/02-creative-policy.md` — creative acceptance policy: image
  content, logos, headline and copy rules, claims and savings language,
  CTAs, prohibited and restricted content, localization, review timeline.
- `references/03-image-generation.md` — the three predictable failure modes
  of generated ad imagery, prompt patterns, the negative list, product
  fidelity protocol, composition for aggressive cropping, validation
  checklist.
- `references/04-rejection-triage.md` — rejection reason to fix.
- `references/05-video-assets.md` — Sponsored Brands and display video specs.
- `references/06-handoff-contract.md` — asset manifest schema for downstream
  agents and the Ads MCP, with pre-moderation guidance.
- Optional `amazon_ads` MCP declaration; the skill functions standalone.
